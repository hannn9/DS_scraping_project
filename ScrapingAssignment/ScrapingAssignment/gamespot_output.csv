Title;Rating Number;Rating Word;Review;Author Information
Battlefield 5 Review - On The Front Lines;8;Great; It's a fine execution of a familiar formula. There are rough spots, but Battlefield V incorporates small, effective tweaks and truly shines in the more focused objective-based modes.;Battlefield 1942 was a major reason Michael got into PC gaming as a kid, and he's played every entry since (to varying degrees). He still considers Battlefield 2 to be his favorite multiplayer experience ever. Michael spent 35 hours with the PC version of Battlefield V for review
The Quiet Man Review - Silence Is Not Golden;2;Terrible; The Quiet Man is an almost completely silent beat-em-up that combines badly staged live-action drama with a clunky, broken combat system.;Calum Marsh endured three long, unhappy hours with The Quiet Man and politely declines the opportunity to play through it again with sound. He played on PS4.
Overkill's The Walking Dead Review - DOA;3;Bad; Overkill's The Walking Dead is a collection of poorly conceived ideas and uninspired gameplay, neither of which help its lifeless narrative and repetitive missions.;Alessandro braved the undead over 15 hours of play, which involved numerous hours of grinding and boring loot drops to simply progress the uninspired story. He's not exactly looking forward to the next season. Code was provided by the publisher for the purposes of this review.
Full Metal Furies Review - Puzzle-Brawler;8;Great; From the creators of Rogue Legacy, Full Metal Furies is a challenging co-op game that seamlessly ties together the brawler and puzzle genres while also telling a humorous story.;Jordan Ramee played Full Metal Furies for the first time on Xbox One, where he and his friends only managed to figure out the game's hardest riddles after they penciled in pages of notes and discussed possible solutions for hours. For the purposes of this review, he replayed the game on Nintendo Switch using a code provided by Cellar Door Games.
11-11: Memories Retold Review - Modernist Warfare;7;Good; 11-11: Memories Retold is an exquisitely painted, touchingly told and occasionally tedious war story.;David Wildgoose was very pleased to discover the cat Kurt befriends early in the game is actually a playable character later on. More games where you get to press X to meow, please.
Spyro Reignited Trilogy Review - Fan The Flames;8;Great; Spyro glides into the current gen prettier than ever and as fun as ever.;Justin Clark played through all three Spyro games in about four hours each. In case you were wondering, no, L1 + Triangle does nothing this time. A code was provided by the publisher for the purposes of this review.
Tetris Effect Review - Feel The Groove;9;Superb; Tetris Effect transforms the classic puzzle game through the power of music. It's hard to put down, and even harder to stop thinking about.;Peter completed Tetris Effects' Journey mode on Normal difficulty and spent a bit of time with each of the optional alternate modes before writing his review. A complimentary copy of the game was provided by Enhance Inc.
Pokemon Let's Go Pikachu And Let's Go Eevee Review;8;Great; A beautiful reimagining of one of the series' most beloved adventures.;Pokemon Red was the first game Jake ever played, so returning to Kanto was a big deal to him. After 45 hours, he completed the Kanto Pokedex and caught two shinies. Review copies were provided by Nintendo.
Sinner: Sacrifice for Redemption Review - Trials and Tribulations;6;Fair; Sinner: Sacrifice for Redemption is a bonafide boss rush buffet with an inventive twist, though its aesthetic presentation quickly grows dull.;Ginny Woo's love for Souls-likes borders on the masochistic. She spent 20 hours happily traipsing around in Sinner: Sacrifice for Redemption's swamp of religious horror and aggressively morose orchestral music on Switch, PS4 and PC thanks to codes provided by the publisher for review purposes.
Diablo 3: Eternal Collection Switch Review - Better With Age;9;Superb; Diablo 3 remains a clever, rewarding, and oftentimes brilliant action-RPG that has made a near seamless transition to Nintendo Switch, six years after its original release.;Mike Mahardy has spent more than 600 hours playing Diablo 3 throughout his life (50 of which took place on Switch) and he somehow still doesn't regret it.
Hitman 2 Review - You Can Stop Hitting Me Now;8;Great; Fantastic new level designs, minor but meaningful additions, and a few excellent bonuses help strengthen the endurance of the Hitman series.;Edmond fondly remembers needing to use the bathroom in Hitman: Codename 47, and the Hitman reboot was one of his favorite games of 2016. He reviewed Hitman 2 on PC with some additional playtime on PS4 using codes provided by the publisher.
Call Of Cthulhu Review - Squid Logic;5;Mediocre; Call of Cthulhu is a mostly competent, occasionally chilling adventure ruined by unspeakable horrors.;David Wildgoose wants to spare you the pain he endured. If you do play this game then know this: In the art gallery section, the dagger you need to thrust into the painting is the one furthest away from you at the start. You'll know it when you get there.
Black Bird Review - Featherweight;5;Mediocre; Black Bird‰Ûªs irreverent take on shoot-'em-up is fun while it lasts, but there‰Ûªs not enough content to sustain repeat playthroughs.;Tom finished up Black Bird in less than 30 minutes but plugged away for more than five hours to climb ever so slowly up the leaderboards. A Switch code was provided by the developer for the purposes of this review.
My Hero One's Justice Review - In Their Own Quirky Ways;6;Fair; My Hero One's Justice captures the feeling of superpowered heroes and villains fighting against one another in destructive arena battles but doesn't do justice to My Hero Academia's story.;After keeping up with the My Hero Academia manga, anime, and Vigilantes spin-off, as well as playing My Hero One's Justice for 10 hours, Jordan can confirm that Bakugo is best boy. He played on Xbox One X using a code provided by Bandai Namco for the purposes of this review.
Gwent Review - Heart Of The Cards;8;Great; Gwent's revamped ruleset and eagerness to reward your time spent with it make it a compelling multiplayer endeavor in The Witcher universe.;Alessandro stuck with the Northern Realms for most of his decks and became really skilled at chaining together Charge and Order cards. He still hasn't managed a full nine-game streak in Arena, though. Code was provided by the publisher for the purposes of this review.
Transistor Review;8;Great; With a gorgeous audiovisual style, unconventional science fiction narrative, and empowering combat system, Transistor is a distinctive and memorable experience.;Carolyn played through Transistor's story twice on the PlayStation 4, using the new game plus option to go through it a second time. She also tested out the PC version a bit. In the interests of transparency, she'd like you to know that she was an avid reader of GameSpot when Supergiant Games' creative director, Greg Kasavin, wrote for the site, and she has had friendly chats with him on a few occasions.
Red Dead Redemption 2 Review - Wild Wild West;9;Superb; PS4 and Xbox One's RDR 2 succeeds as both a prequel to the first Red Dead Redemption and a story in its own right;Kallie spent around 55 hours playing Red Dead Redemption 2, completing the main story, a handful of side quests, and a robbery or two. She played on PS4 Pro using a code provided by Rockstar for the purposes of this review.
Football Manager 2019 Review - A Winning Strategy;8;Great; Football Manager 2019 redesigns its tactical interface to give you the tools to create a playstyle you'll spend the next 200 hours obsessing over.;Richard has been a wannabe football manager for over 10 years now and spent around 50 hours tinkering with every aspect of his team in Football Manager 2019. A PC copy of the game was provided by the publisher for review.
Deracine Review - Elementary;5;Mediocre; Deracine's gorgeous presentation masks a game that's lacking innovative ideas while misusing the few it does have.;Alessandro explored the mysterious boarding school through two separate playthroughs, with the first journey taking around four hours to complete. He consistently tried to get past the school's black cat without any success. Code was provided by the publisher for the purposes of this review.
Cities: Skylines - Industries Review - The Up And Up;7;Good; Create smokestacks and jobs in Industries, the detailed new expansion for Cities: Skylines that lets you put natural resources to good use.;Brett has played many, many hours of Cities: Skylines for review. He dedicated about a dozen hours to industrializing Cities: Skylines using a code provided by the publisher for purposes of this review.
SNK 40th Anniversary Collection Review - It Belongs In A Museum;8;Great; A portion of SNK's pre-Neo Geo library is given the archaeological treatment in the diverse and educational SNK 40th Anniversary Collection.;Peter has been a fan of SNK for years, but has spent relatively little time playing games from the pre-Neo Geo era. He played each game in the collection a few times while preparing for his review, and wholeheartedly appreciates the available assist options that made up for his lack of skill. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game for review.
Reigns: Game Of Thrones Review: A Westerosi Romp;8;Great; Reigns: Game of Thrones makes smart use of the license on which its based, offering smart writing and a wide array of scenarios to tackle.;Chris is a big Song of Ice and Fire fan who foolishly thinks we still might get a new book someday. He spent more than six hours exploring Reigns: Game of Thrones' many possibilities and is looking forward to uncovering more of its mysteries. Devolver Digital provided an iOS code for the purpose of this review.
Dark Souls Remastered Switch Review: A Very Special Revisit;8;Great; With Dark Souls Remastered now on Nintendo Switch, you'll be able to experience one of the decade's greatest role-playing games in an interesting new way.;Alessandro has been following From Software's Souls series for nearly 10 years, and has played every installment. Bloodborne is his personal favorite. Playing on the Nintendo Switch, he spent well over 25 hours re-experiencing the hardships and eventual triumphs found in Dark Souls. Bandai Namco provided codes for the purposes of this review.
Call Of Duty: Black Ops 4 Review - Zombies Blackout Multiplayer;8;Great; Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 is both broad and deep, but the star is its smartly executed take on battle royale, Blackout.;Kallie started playing FPS games at a young age with her dad, who still plays Call of Duty. She lost track of how many hours of Black Ops 4 she played, but she split her time evenly between multiplayer, Zombies, and Blackout. Activision provided PS4 copies for the purposes of this review.
Return Of The Obra Dinn Review: The Good Ship;9;Superb; Return of the Obra Dinn is a startlingly original detective adventure full of murder, mutiny, and monsters.;"David Wildgoose filled his own spiral-bound pad with notes reading ""Frenchman was torn apart?"", ""guy who was accidentally shot after being spiked and crawling away was shot by another guy"" and ""last seen on deck grabbed by tentacle"" during the dozen or so hours it took to play through this game. He recommends you do the same."
SoulCalibur 6 Review - The New Legend;8;Great; The sixth entry in Bandai Namco's weapons-based fighting series makes a strong return.;Tamoor has been a Nightmare main since the first SoulCalibur. His thirst for souls is endless. A PS4 copy of the game was provided by the publisher for review.
WWE 2K19 Review: A Step In The Right Direction;7;Good; While not much has changed between the ropes, WWE 2K19 gives you more reasons to play by featuring a plethora of new modes and content.;Richard has been watching wrestling since the days of WWE's Attitude Era, and spent around 30 hours with WWE 2K19. He also wishes Roman Reigns a speedy recovery. A PS4 copy of the game was provided by the publisher for review.
Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales Review - Queen Of Cards;9;Superb; Thronebreaker's compelling characters accent a strong re-imagining of Gwent and a gripping single-player story.;Alessandro rode into battle with Meve and slayed countless cards throughout the 25-hour campaign, gathering a good percentage of optional hidden chests, beating most puzzle challenges, and making incredibly tough decisions along the way. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game for review.
Lego DC Super-Villains Review: Mediocre Mischief-Makers;5;Mediocre; Despite an impressive roster and some top-notch actors to voice them, Lego DC Super-Villains is a tedious game that fails to capitalize on its best qualities.;Justin Clark finished Lego DC Super-Villains' story and spent about three hours fooling around in Free Play. He also spent four hours one day in the character creator. He regrets nothing. A review code was provided by the publisher.
Super Mario Party Review - Test Those Friendships;7;Good; With Super Mario Party on Switch, Nintendo's 20-year-old party franchise ditches its staple randomness for more of a strategic game.;When Jordan first tried the original Mario Party, he had no idea the game would inspire a hobby that would eventually become a career. It took Jordan about 15 hours to gather Super Mario Party's five Gems and achieve Super Stardom. Nintendo provided codes for the purposes of this review.
NBA 2K Playgrounds 2 Review - Ball Another Day;5;Mediocre; There's fun to be had in 2K's arcade-style basketball game, but a lack of variety and flawed gameplay make for a missed opportunity.;Michael was hyped to team up Patrick Ewing and Gary Payton, two of his favorite players growing up, in NBA 2K Playgrounds 2. He misses balling up at Skyline Park back home in Southeast San Diego where ball is life. He put around 10 hours into NBA 2K Playgrounds 2 for this review, and code was provided by 2K Sports. Michael also reviewed NBA 2K19, the simulation basketball experience from the same publisher.
The Missing Review - Lost And Found;8;Great; The Missing is a dark, confronting puzzle-platformer that offers light at the end of the tunnel.;David Wildgoose never liked camping and The Missing has only reaffirmed that belief. He now also doesn't like windmills, sawmills, those cymbal-clapping monkey toys, and islands. The game was completed in around 6 hours using a code provided by Arc System Works.
Starlink: Battle for Atlas Review - Endless Space;7;Good; Starlink is a fun, albeit repetitive, game of space combat and exploration--but the digital version of the game is the way to go if you're on a budget.;James O'Connor was sent the entire toy line and the Digital Deluxe edition of the game by Ubisoft for review. He tested the toys during his 20-odd hours with the game but preferred the convenience of the digital ships, pilots, and weapons after the first few hours. He's a big Star Fox fan, too.
Chasm Review: The Battle Below;8;Great; Chasm's sharp combat mechanics and rich visual design make it easier to bear the inconsistent difficulty curve.;Tom took more than 12 hours to finish Chasm (not including reloading saves after deaths) using a Steam code provided by the developer. He saw 99.9% of the map and cannot believe he couldn't find the last secret.
Luigi's Mansion Review - Old Haunts;7;Good; The GameCube classic comes to the 3DS with minimal changes, and it's held up pretty well.;James O'Connor first played through Luigi's Mansion in 2003 and is happy to return to it half a lifetime later. He spent about five and a half hours finishing the game (with every portrait ghost and Boo caught) on a New Nintendo 3DS XL, then spent some further time in the Hidden Mansion mode. A copy of the game was supplied by Nintendo.
Assassin's Creed Odyssey Review - Glory Of Sparta;8;Great; With Assassin's Creed Odyssey on PC, PS4, and Xbox One, Ubisoft continues the series' expansion into a bigger open world, offering an impressive follow-up to Origins.;Alessandro is a longtime fan of the Assassin's Creed series and was looking forward to diving into Odyssey's large-scale adventure. Playing on both the PS4 and PS4 Pro, he spent well over 60 hours exploring the game's massive world. Ubisoft provided codes for the purposes of this review.
Armello Review - Nintendo Switch Update;8;Great; Board gaming come to life, with none of the missing pieces.;Janine Hawkins had no idea she wanted a mash-up of beloved childhood murder planning kit 13 Dead End Drive and Brian Jacques' Redwall books, but that's an itch that Armello definitely scratches. Even better, she doesn't have to play it alone on the living room carpet.
Pathfinder: Kingmaker Review - The Classics;6;Fair; Pathfinder: Kingmaker is a classical RPG brought to PC with some exceptional moments, though it's dragged down by a brutal difficulty curve.;Lifelong western RPG fan Dan Starkey got his start on roleplaying in his early teens, starting with Pathfinder before making the transition to d20-based video games like Baldur‰Ûªs Gate and Knights of the Old Republic. He was provided code on release day for the purposes of review.
Child of Light Review;8;Great; Child of Light is a singular adventure that embraces sadness in a beautiful, affecting way.;Tom was touched by the somber tone of Child of Light and wishes more games would explore this untapped feeling. He spent more than 15 hours within this world, and is eager to revisit it.
World of Warcraft: Battle For Azeroth - Come One Come All;7;Good; Faction politics are the backbone of Battle for Azeroth, but the real victories are the friends that you make along the way.;Ginny Woo spends way too much time in online universes and not enough time sleeping. For the purposes of this review, Ginny reached max level on both factions and took the scenic route through all the leveling zones in Battle for Azeroth. In terms of post-launch content, she‰Ûªs cut her teeth on the first two wings of Uldir and assaulted Arathi Highlands as part of the Horde‰Ûªs latest military effort.
My Memory of Us Review - War Has Changed;5;Mediocre; A puzzle-platformer as World War II allegory that can't settle on an appropriate tone or interesting puzzles.;Schindler's List was the first movie that made James cry. He spent just over five hours playing through My Memory of Us. A code was provided by the publisher for the purposes of this review.
FIFA 19 Nintendo Switch Review - Offside;5;Mediocre; Nintendo Switch gets an updated version of FIFA 19, but it's lacking much of what makes EA's footballing giant special.;Oscar spends more time trading FUT players than he cares to admit. EA provided complimentary copies of FIFA 19 on Switch for the purposes of this review.
Mega Man 11 Review - An Uneven Retro Romp;7;Good; Mega Man 11 is a solid return for the Blue Bomber, but it's held back somewhat by overly long and frustrating stage design.;Heidi has been playing Mega Man games since the original. She has a soft spot for X4, but 3 is her favorite of the classic series. She also ran a Mega Man music Geocities page as a teenager. Heidi completed Mega Man 11 on both Casual and Normal difficulties for this review using a code provided by the publisher.
The Bard's Tale IV: Barrows Deep Review - Lament;4;Poor; You'll need a lot of patience to make it through InXile Entertainment's nostalgic RPG, The Bard's Tale IV: Barrows Deep.;Brett spent over 60 hours trudging through the old-time conundrums and combat of The Bard's Tale IV: Barrows Deep. Code was provided by the publisher for the purposes of this review.
Destiny 2: Forsaken Review - A Grindhouse;8;Great; Destiny 2's Forsaken expansion is dense and rewarding, though it does require a bit of patience.;Kallie lost track of how many hours of Forsaken she played over the last three and a half weeks, but she did get Ace of Spades before they nerfed the quest requirements. She did it for Cayde. She played on PS4 using code provided by the publisher.
Fist Of The North Star: Lost Paradise Review - Be The Tough Boy;8;Great; Fist of the North Star: Lost Paradise offers a solid display of drama and action that captures exactly what makes the series so great.;"Matt became a huge fan of Fist of the North Star in the lead-up to Lost Paradise's release. He teared up a few times while playing and proclaimed in shock, ""To think that I, Matt, still had tears left!"" He played about 30 hours of the game using a review code provided by Sega."
Final Fantasy XV: Pocket Edition HD Review - Nintendo Switch;7;Good; Square delivers most of Final Fantasy XV in a smaller, but no less epic, package.;Justin Clark spent 40 hours with Pocket Edition on Switch. He will not rest until there‰Ûªs a Persona: Dancing All Night-type game with Noctis and crew performing BTS songs. A review code was provided by the publisher.
FIFA 19 Review - Golazo;7;Good; FIFA 19 is back for a new season, but how do its brand new Kick Off modes, third chapter of The Journey, and new FUT features fare?;For his sins, Oscar spends most of his time attempting to get his beloved Bristol City into the Champions League. Europe in five years, here we go! Complimentary codes were provided by EA for the purposes of this review.
Cities: Skylines Review - In The Zone;8;Great; Smart attention to details like zoning and policy decisions make Cities: Skylines the most authentic city-builder you can play.;Even though real-life mayor Brett Todd plays games to get away from real-world politics, he still enjoyed spending some 20 hours in the virtual world of Cities: Skylines.
Forza Horizon 4 Review - Shifting Gears Shifting Seasons;9;Superb; Playground Games continues to master the art of driving games that are both accessible and complex, and Horizon 4's numerous meaningful changes keep the series lively and looking fantastic.;In the past two years, Edmond has road-tripped across both Great Britain and Australia, and drifted cars on a frozen lake. Horizon is cheaper, though. He spent roughly 37 hours playing on PC with additional testing on Xbox One X, listening to nothing but Timeless FM, using a code provided by Microsoft.
The Gardens Between Review - Dance Among The Stars;8;Great; With a bittersweet story and a gorgeous, dreamlike world, The Gardens Between is time-bending puzzle game that you won't soon forget.;Peter played through The Gardens Between in a few hours on Nintendo Switch using complimentary code provided by The Voxel Agents.
Wasteland 2: Director's Cut Nintendo Switch Review;8;Great; Wasteland 2 gets the Switch port treatment, bringing a deep, involved RPG to Nintendo's hybrid console.;Long-time Western RPG fan Dan Starkey got his start on roleplaying in his early teens, starting with Pathfinder and moving into other systems before shuffling over to their video counterparts like KOTOR. He was provided code ahead of release for the purposes of review.
Zone Of The Enders: The 2nd Runner - MARS Review;5;Mediocre; Zone of the Enders comes to the current gen in better shape than ever, but still an artifact of its time.;Justin Clark played through ZOE: 2nd Runner in about seven hours. He still has no idea what the hell the title means. A code was provided by the publisher.
Frozen Synapse 2 Review - Cool-Headed;8;Great; Frozen Synapse 2 is a stylish, tense, and tactical game of chess. With guns.;James Swinbanks spent 21 hours trawling the cyber streets and outwitting foes with his Bureau-8 squad, using code provided by the publisher for review purposes.
Nintendo Labo Vehicle Kit Review: The Most Fun Labo Yet;7;Good; Labo's newest kit features much more gameplay than its predecessor, but it's still best enjoyed with a junior partner in tow.;Randolph and his nine-year-old son tag teamed building the various Joy-Cons, with Bastian doing most of the folding and Randy taking over any time rubber bands or fiddly stickers were involved. Bastian, however, did most of the work in Adventure Mode. GameSpot was provided the Labo Vehicle Kit courtesy of Nintendo.
NHL 19 Review - A Barnburner;8;Great; NHL 19 controls exceptionally well and looks fantastic, and the new outdoor hockey mode nails the essence of hockey culture.;Eddie spent around 20 hours playing NHL 19 using a code provided by Electronic Arts.
Undertale Review - Nintendo Switch Update;9;Superb; Undertale exceeds expectations, when it isn't busy subverting them.;Tyler Hicks grew up on single-player RPGs, with Suikoden 2 topping his list of favorites. For this review, he played through Undertale twice.
Star Control: Origins Review - Space Oddity;6;Fair; Star Control: Origins is a jolly space adventure that falters when it takes on too much action.;David Wildgoose started writing about games professionally the year after Star Control 2 was released. If you laid end-to-end every word he's written about games in those 25 years it would probably stretch to the moon and back, as long as you printed them in a very large font. He spent around 30 hours with Star Control: Origins with a code provided by the publisher.
Life Is Strange 2: Episode 1 Review - What Doesn't Kill Us;9;Superb; Life Is Strange 2 kicks off with a diverse cast of strongly-defined characters, a narrative shaped by real-world sociopolitical issues, and the love between two brothers at the root of ...;Jess has played every Life Is Strange installment and spent eight hours with Life Is Strange 2: Episode 1 on PC over the course of two playthroughs: one where she played as a lawful, friendly Sean and another as the world's worst brother. The latter made her feel really bad.
Broken Sword 5: The Serpent's Curse Review;8;Great; Broken Sword 5: The Serpent's Curse returns the series to its former glory with excellent storytelling and characters.;Cameron Woolsey has clicked his way through many adventures starring cartoon dogs, rabbits, and a talking skeleton. For the purpose of this review, Cameron played the game from start to finish.
Lamplight City Review - Cold Case;6;Fair; Lamplight City is a detective adventure with a lot of good ideas, but it executes them with too light a touch.;James O'Connor spent just under 12 hours finishing Lamplight City, and then went back in to explore different options and pathways. He's a long-time fan of point-and-click adventure games. Review code was provided by the publisher.
Dragon Quest XI: Echoes Of An Elusive Age Review - Back To The Good-Old Days;9;Superb; Steeped in tradition and not afraid to show it, Dragon Quest XI reflects the best qualities of the series' past.;Heidi has been playing RPGS since her childhood. She put 85 hours into finishing Dragon Quest XI and doesn‰Ûªt regret a moment of the time spent with her merry adventuring band. Also, her favorite game in the series is Dragon Quest V. Complimentary review code was provided by Square Enix.
Valkyria Chronicles 4 Review - Soar High;8;Great; With a strong return to its unique strategy roots, Valkyria Chronicles 4 is the franchise's golden ticket to Valhalla.;Ginny's introduction to the Valkyria Chronicles series was the franchise's first installment on the PS3. After an unfortunate skirmish with Valkyria Revolution, she was presently surprised to find Valkyria Chronicles 4 in fighting form and engaged in about 40 hours of friendly fire on Nintendo Switch, using a code provided by the publisher.
Telltale's The Walking Dead: The Final Season Episode 2 Review;8;Great; What might be the final episode of Telltale's The Walking Dead is beautiful, brutal, and bittersweet.;Justin Clark played through Suffer the Children twice. We'll always have Fabletown. A code was provided by the publisher.
Transference Review - In Another World;7;Good; Transference's distressing subject matter and eerie atmosphere make for a strong horror experience, even if some of its potential is squandered by a non-committal narrative.;Alessandro felt uncomfortable in Transference the entirety of its three-hour runtime. He explored more of the haunting apartment after the credits rolled to uncover additional video logs and test out VR functionality. Code was provided by the publisher for the purposes of this review.
Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate Review - A Formidable Beast;7;Good; Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate is the epitome of a good game that can be hard to recommend.;Dan Starkey's been a fan of action-adventure games of all sorts for two decades. He was a latecomer to the Monster Hunter series, starting with the fourth entry. He ran more than his share of quests with friends on Monster Hunter Generations, however, and was a big fan of the streamlined Monster Hunter World. He was provided code by the publisher for the purposes of review and spent three dozen hours revisiting old friends and foes.
NBA 2K19 Review - Another Year Another Baller;7;Good; This year's iteration of NBA 2K packs plenty of game modes and deep mechanics that occasionally falter. And unfortunately again, VC rules everything around it.;Michael's been breaking ankles on screen since NBA Live 95 back when he loved watching Gary Payton and the Sonics. He misses balling up at Skyline Park in his hometown of Southeast San Diego even though he always got crossed up. He's played past NBA 2K games to get hyped for each season, and spent 40 hours with NBA 2K19 to dig into MyCareer, MyTeam, MyGM, and Play Now matches. The game was provided by 2K Sports for review.
The Golf Club 2019 Review;8;Great; With a new PGA Tour license, difficult but fair controls, and a pleasing presentation, The Golf Club 2019 is a straight shot down the fairway.;Eddie Makuch spent around 20 hours playing The Golf Club 2019. He played on PC using a code provided by 2K.
Little Dragons Cafe Review - Dragging On;6;Fair; Little Dragons Cafe's charming world and cafe management are enjoyable, but it's held back by significant pacing issues.;Kallie played a lot of Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life on GameCube, and Little Dragons Cafe reminds her of those times--for better and worse. She played 40 hours using a review code provided by the publisher.
Hollow Knight Review - An Exceptional Adventure;9;Superb; Hollow Knight's sprawling world, precise combat, and wealth of content make its trip through Hollownest engrossing and rewarding.;Alessandro spent over 30 hours exploring every nook and cranny of Hollownest, achieving just under 70% completion on his first run. He spent a few more hours tackling the game's free DLC and falling countless times to the brutal challenges of Godmaster.
The Messenger Review: Shuriken Sharp;8;Great; Inspired by the 8-bit and 16-bit action-platformers of yesteryear, The Messenger is an ambitious and well-balanced side-scroller that's as difficult as it is funny.;Alexander spent over 20 hours perfecting his vast array of ninja skills in his successful delivery of the all-important scroll. Additional testing of the Switch version was handled by GameSpot staff. Complimentary review code for The Messenger was provided for the purposes of this review.
Dragon Ball FighterZ Review: The Fast And The Furious;9;Superb; Dragon Ball FighterZ is a great fighting game and an exciting revitalization of Dragon Ball Z's glory days.;Peter has considered himself a fan of both Dragon Ball and fighting games for the last 25 years. He completed all three story arcs and tested the other modes in the retail version of FighterZ, in addition to participating in the open beta, prior to writing his review. GameSpot was provided with complimentary copies of the game by Bandai Namco.
Into The Breach Review: A Mechanized Masterpiece;9;Superb; Subset Games' FTL follow-up is a pristine and pragmatic tactical gem with dynamic conflicts that will inspire you to jump Into the Breach again, and again, and again.;Edmond Tran has spent over 100 hours with FTL across different platforms, and 40 hours with Into The Breach so far, with a copy provided by the developer. He's still hanging out for that spiritual successor to Front Mission 3, though.
Divinity: Original Sin 2 Review - Definitive Edition Update;10;Essential; Divinity: Original Sin II Definitive Edition manages to make an already fantastic RPG even better.;Brett spent more than 70 hours questing his way to godhood in the original Divinity: Original Sin 2 on PC, and then did it all over again with the Definitive Edition on PS4 (and had no regrets!). GameSpot was provided with complimentary copies of the game by Larian Studios.
Marvel's Spider-Man PS4 Review: Amazing Fantasy;9;Superb; A spectacular cinematic presentation and sensational core mechanics help Insomniac's take on a Spider-Man game shine, in spite of some unimaginative open-world activities.;Edmond isn't ashamed to tell you that his favorite superhero game is Marvel Puzzle Quest. He hit 100% completion on Marvel's Spider-Man before writing this review, using a code provided by the publisher.
Yakuza Kiwami 2 Review: Double Dragon;8;Great; Old and new components of the Yakuza franchise combine to create one of the series' strongest entries.;Edmond Tran has been a devoted Yakuza series fan since 2006, and Yakuza 2 has always been his favorite. He spent over 25 hours with Yakuza Kiwami 2, finishing the campaign and half of the optional content using a code provided by the publisher.
PES 2019 Review;9;Superb; Pro Evolution Soccer 2019 continues the series' excellent run of form, introducing smart improvements that enhance the on-pitch action.;Richard has been playing PES since the good old days when it still had the International Superstar Soccer moniker. So far he's spent around 30 hours on PES 2019, with many more to come. Complimentary review code was provided by Konami.
Planet Alpha Review: A Beautiful Planet;7;Good; Planet Alpha's glorious vistas are worth seeing, even though its mechanics aren't particularly unique.;James O'Connor enjoyed how bright and beautiful Planet Alpha was during his eight-hour journey through the game. He's also wondering if it's time to replay Limbo, though. He played on PlayStation 4 using a code provided by the publisher.
Freedom Planet Review -- Speedy Ambitions;7;Good; Freedom Planet's fast-paced thrills and challenging boss fights make for a joyous retro outing, but don't expect the same highs from its mediocre story.;Matt is a big fan of Sonic and is always down to play a game inspired by Sega's iconic blue hedgehog. He played about six hours of Freedom Planet using a review code provided by the publisher.
Shadow Of The Tomb Raider Review - Guerilla Girl;6;Fair; Raiding ancient tombs and exploring dense environments is still outstanding in Lara's latest, but the mechanics of the reboot series are getting as rough and unpredictable as the terrain.;Tomb Raider was the reason Edmond begged for a new Pentium PC in 1996, and he's played most of Lara's adventures since then. He finished Shadow of the Tomb Raider's campaign with 89% total game completion, flipping between normal and hard difficulties, using a code provided by Square Enix.
428: Shibuya Scramble Review - When Fates Collide;8;Great; The unique presentation and excellent storytelling of 428: Shibuya Scramble make it a great visual novel experience.;Heidi has enjoyed many visual novels and was eager to see why so many folks overseas were so excited about 428. She finished all the scenarios and got to the default ending, but she‰Ûªs now going back and replaying things to see if she can unlock another outcome. Review code was provided by the publisher.
Strange Brigade Review - Co-op With Style;7;Good; Strange Brigade is a delightful cooperative shooter with some technical issues and an idea that isn't given enough room to breathe.;Dan Starkey has craved co-op adventures since he ran through the original Perfect Dark with some friends back in grade school. Since then he's loved working with pals and buds to clear some of gaming's most enriching challenges. He spent 14 hours over the course of a week dipping into the '30s-inspired world of Strange Brigade. A copy of the game was provided by the publisher for the review.
NBA Live 19 Review - Dribbling Forward;7;Good; EA's NBA Live franchise returns with its best effort in a while capturing the spirit and atmosphere of basketball culture, but it's not without its problems.;Eddie played around 20 hours of NBA Live 19, including a Franchise season with the Celtics. He played on Xbox One X using a code provided by the publisher.
Two Point Hospital Review - Laughter Is The Best Medicine;8;Great; Two Point Hospital offers more than just nostalgia for classic management sims.;In the 20 hours he spent with Two Point Hospital, James Swinbanks cured 1284 patients, and he‰Ûªs not even a real doctor! He played using code provided by the publisher for review purposes.
Death's Gambit Review - A Maddening Mission;6;Fair; This 2D action-platformer is a gorgeous but frustrating test of patience.;James Swinbanks took 15 hours to wipe the world of its immortal inhabitants and appease Death. He used PC code provided by the publisher for review purposes.
Donut County Review: Pit Falls;6;Fair; Donut County is high on charm but short on substance;
Mega Man X Legacy Collection 1 + 2 Review: Mega Museum;8;Great; An homage to the full breadth of Mega Man X's history shows that some parts of its legacy have aged much better than others.;Steve tested both collections on Switch and PlayStation 4. Capcom provided GameSpot with complimentary download codes of the game
The Walking Dead - The Final Season Episode 1: Done Running Review;8;Great; Telltale begins the final verse of Clementine's ballad on a high note.;Justin Clark played through Done Running twice, taking about two hours for each playthrough. He once had an afro just like A.J.'s. He doesn't like talking about that time of his life much. A code was provided by the publisher.
H1Z1 Battle Royale PS4 Review: All Kills No Frills;7;Good; The PS4 version of H1Z1 Battle Royale provides a simple, streamlined experience with the thrills of the genre's high-stakes combat. Nothing more, nothing less.;Michael took on the role of critiquing battle royale games, having reviewed PUBG, Fortnite, H1Z1 on PC, and now the PS4 version of H1Z1. He put about 20 hours into H1Z1 on PS4, roughly split between the open beta and official release. A lot of time was put into the early access PC version back in the day, and for some reason he feels very cool for being on the battle royale hype train before everyone else.
Earthfall Review: An Inferior Invasion;4;Poor; Earthfall is too derivative to stand out and too disappointing to inspire repeat trips through its 10 mediocre missions.;James Swinbanks tried to save the world from aliens for 12 hours before getting bored and letting them take it. He played the Xbox One version of Earthfall using code provided by the publisher.
F1 2018 Review - Victory Lap;9;Superb; F1 2018 nails a new lap record with its most complete package to date.;After spending 30 hours with F1 2018 and winning the World Championship with Red Bull Racing, James Swinbanks retired to Monaco to spend his remaining days on a yacht the size of a house. He reviewed the PS4 version of F1 2018 using code provided by the publisher.
Semblance Review;7;Good; A level-morphing puzzle game with enough charm and ingenuity to overcome its control issues and short length.;James O'Connor was won over by Semblance in the end and found that the game more-or-less did what it promised, if not a lot more. He enjoys puzzle platformers as a general rule. Review code was provided by the publisher on both Switch and PC.
Monster Hunter World Review - Deadliest Catch;8;Great; Monster Hunter World successfully proves that it's both about size and how you use it.;Ginny Woo got her first taste of being the hunter and the hunted upon Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate's release. The franchise combines her love of dinosaurs with her passion for heavy weaponry, and she's been ready to sink her teeth into Monster Hunter World since it was announced at E3 2017. For the purposes of this review, Ginny played around 60 hours solo and with others on the PS4 and around 20 hours on the PC using copies provided by Capcom.
WarioWare Gold Review - Worth Its Weight;8;Great;" The ""ultimate"" WarioWare game mixes together all three different handheld play styles we've seen before.";James O'Connor played the original WarioWare religiously, mastering every microgame to unlock Pyoro 2.

Combined, he's spent over 100 hours with No Man's Sky. He's looking forward to 100 more. A copy of the full game for Xbox One was provided by the publisher.
Unavowed Review: Dressed To Possess;9;Superb; With an exceptional mystery, genuine characters and brilliant writing, Unavowed is a phenomenal adventure.;David Rayfield is pretty sure that either he's possessed by a demon or everyone else is. Hopefully, he'll figure it out before it's too late. He reviewed Unavowed on PC, with the first playthrough taking about 12 hours.
Dead Cells Review: Rise From Your Grave;9;Superb; Dead Cells is an incredibly satisfying mishmash of genres that's more than the sum of its parts.;Dan Starkey is a fan of all things Soulsian. Though he‰Ûªs a recent-ish inductee to the Souls-like fandom, he‰Ûªs taken the meditative combat and beautifully laid out worlds as some of his all-time favorites. He pushed through only one complete run of Dead Cells among 140 some-odd attempts over about 25 hours. He loved it.
We Happy Few Review;4;Poor; We Happy Few's borderline broken systems and unremarkable quest design make it an unentertaining slog through an intriguing world.;Alessandro behaved as well as he could within Wellington Wells, but he found it easier to break We Happy Few's rules rather than conform to them. He completed all three character stories in just under 30 hours. Code was provided by the publisher for the purposes of this review.
Phantom Doctrine Review: Tactical Espionage Action;9;Superb; Phantom Doctrine blends several complex mechanics and a well-realized Cold War setting into one brilliantly engaging experience.;Alexander Pan spent over 40 hours spying, connecting photos on a corkboard using pieces of string, and flip-flopping between the CIA and KGB without being caught. The PC version of Phantom Doctrine was tested, using a code provided by the publisher.
The Banner Saga 3 Review;8;Great; Smart adjustments to mechanics make the act of playing the Banner Saga series finale feel as suspenseful as the story it tells.;Edmond Tran has played through every entry of The Banner Saga at least twice on PC, but just can't get used to the gamepad controls on consoles. Gunnulf is his Banner Saga BFF.
Guacamelee 2 Review - Ready For A Challenge;9;Superb; Guacamelee 2 doubles down on what worked in the original and presents the most formidable challenges yet.;Justin Clark's playthrough of Guacamelee 2 topped out at 15 hours. He has not stopped making Spanish-based puns to his friends and family all week. Yes, this is a cry for help. A code was provided by the publisher.
Madden NFL 19 Review;8;Great; Madden NFL 19 nails the controls, Franchise gets more attention, and Longshot returns with a memorable story.;Eddie Makuch spent 20 hours playing Madden NFL 19, including around five hours in Longshot: Homecoming. He played on Xbox One X using a code provided by Electronic Arts.
Sonic Mania Plus Review - Encore! Encore!;9;Superb; Sonic Mania remains the best Sonic game ever made, and with its latest update, it's even better than before.;Matt was a huge fan of Sonic the Hedgehog growing up, spending countless hours playing the originals with his older brothers and drawing its characters in spiral notebooks. His favorite game in the series used to be Sonic 3 & Knuckles. Random fact: the Sonic R soundtrack holds a special place in his heart. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy for the purposes of this review.
Overcooked 2 Review - A Great Second Course;8;Great; Overcooked 2 brings new levels and small-but-smart additions to the already great couch co-op formula.;Kallie played around 10 hours of Overcooked 2, splitting time between single-player, two-player co-op, and four-player co-op. She was able to get online and try some co-op there as well. A code was provided for the purposes of this review.
The King's Bird Review: A Rocky Flight;5;Mediocre; The lovely aesthetics and graceful movement in A King‰Ûªs Bird are undercut by a too steep difficulty and imprecise controls.;Tom took a half dozen hours to reach the end of A King‰Ûªs Bird using a Steam code provided by the developer. He‰Ûªs as shocked as anyone that such a pretty platformer could be so unwelcoming.
Onrush Review: Push It To The Limit;9;Superb; Onrush's unique blend of influences results in an innovative and refreshing racing game that replaces the finish line with objectives and teamwork.;Richard spent over 10 hours colliding with other vehicles across Onrush's single and multiplayer modes. A complimentary copy of the game was provided for review.
Flipping Death Review: Scythe Life;7;Good; Flipping Death is a quirky and lovingly crafted adventure that doesn‰Ûªt overstay its welcome.;Seamus spent six hours exploring the town of Flatwood Peaks and messing with every mortal resident he could using a Steam code provided by the developer. Already missing the lovable characters of Flipping Death, he thinks he‰Ûªll need to go back and collect each Ghost Card before he can move on to the next adventure game.
West Of Loathing Review: Wild Wild West;8;Great; Humor courses through West of Loathing's veins, making every minute of this RPG/adventure hybrid a delight.;Edmond Tran played through West of Loathing as a Cow Puncher on PC and a Bean Slinger on Nintendo Switch. He always rides a pale horse.
Mothergunship Review: Bullet-Hell Extravaganza;8;Great; Mothergunship on PC, PS4, and Xbox One is a surprisingly tense and fast-paced shooter that blends the best of classic FPS gameplay with a hardcore roguelike.;Alessandro has fond memories of classic FPS games like Doom and Quake, and he enjoyed powering through Mothergunship's difficult but satisfying missions. He spent six to seven hours clearing the main story, the game's numerous enemies falling victim to his skill in wielding six guns at once. GameSpot was provided a complimentary copy of the game for the purposes of this review.
Moonlighter Review: Open For Business;7;Good; Moonlighter is a delightful adventure into the depths of ancient dungeons and the trials of running an equipment shop.;Dan Starkey cut his teeth on 16-bit adventure titles as so many did, with Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. Enjoying Moonlighter as a loving send up of the genre, he eagerly dipped 12 hours into the maintenance of his shop and countless trips to the depths on PC, and further testing of the PS4 version was handled by GameSpot staff. Complimentary codes were provided for this review.
Jurassic World Evolution Review: Life Finds A Way;7;Good; An enjoyable management sim 65 million years in the making.;After spending over 25 hours with Jurassic World Evolution, James Swinbanks was last spotted tending to the Raptor cage. He was never seen or heard from again. He played both Xbox One and PC versions using code provided by the publisher.
Lumines Remastered: Groove Is In The Heart;8;Great; Lumines makes the jump to current-gen platforms looking and sounding better than ever.;Justin Clark unlocked 20 of Lumines Remastered's skins, completed 25 of its missions, and made countless confused grunting noises while playing Puzzle Mode. A complimentary code was provided by the publisher.
Unravel 2 Review: Partners In Twine;8;Great; Unravel's delightful sequel makes for a fun and breezy co-op adventure.;Justin Clark spent about 5 hours completing Unravel Two and half of its optional challenges. Review code was provided by EA.
Sushi Striker: The Way Of Sushido Review - Cartoon Cuisine Combat;7;Good; Sushi Striker's ridiculous story and fast-paced match-three puzzle gameplay make it one of Switch's most pleasant surprises.;Kevin played through Sushi Striker's main story campaign and ate thousands of plates of sushi (in the game). Nintendo provided GameSpot with a complimentary code for the purpose of this review.
Crash Bandicoot N Sane Trilogy Review: Marsupial Makeover;6;Fair; Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy gives three classic games a fresh coat of paint, but there's no mistaking that they're old at heart.;Peter stayed current with new Crash games during the PlayStation's life span
Mario Tennis Aces Review: Aim High;7;Good; Aces is the most complex and Mario Tennis game yet, but its online modes are missing some key features.;Justin Clark completed Adventure Mode after four days of fire, fury, and perseverance. He dreams of a perfect world where all threats can be neutralized through the power of tennis. A review code was provided by Nintendo.
The Awesome Adventures Of Captain Spirit - Mind Over Matter;8;Great; A complete, free prelude to Life is Strange 2 that has us ready for more.;James O'Connor loves episodic adventure games, and thinks developer Dontnod has a real shot of usurping Telltale's dominance in the genre. He finished The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit on Xbox One three times with a copy of the game provided by the publisher.
Nier: Automata Review;9;Superb; The sequel to Yoko Taro's cult hit is a beautifully frenetic hack-and-slasher with an engrossing and layered story.;Miguel needed 50 hours to reach all of Nier: Automata's five main endings as well as a couple of minor ones. He also checked off 50% of the side missions in the process. Additional testing was handled by other GameSpot staff. Square Enix supplied complimentary codes for all platforms.
The Crew 2 Review - On The Road Again;8;Great; Ubisoft's Transamerican driving game trades in arcade-style fun, variety, and player convenience, though its exploration and multiplayer options leave you wanting.;Edmond Tran prefers to virtually drive cars from the 1970s and kinda wishes Ubisoft would make another Driver game. The Crew 2 was played on PS4 Pro using a code provided by Ubisoft.
Wreckfest Review: Crashing The Party;9;Superb; Destruction Derby meets Flatout in this excellent new racing game.;James Swinbanks rolled his car 37 times and played 15 hours of Wreckfest for the purposes of this review, using a copy purchased during early access.
Octopath Traveler Review: Divide And Conquer;8;Great; Octopath Traveler finds comfort in tradition but doesn't shy away from breaking the mold.;Peter watched the credits roll after completing his protagonist's campaign and then jumped back in to finish three more before writing his review, after 65 hours--he has reached the final chapters of the four remaining stories. Nintendo provided GameSpot with a complimentary copy of the game for review.
Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker Nintendo Switch Review: Time For Adventure;8;Great; Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker's clever puzzles and creative take on platforming remain great on Nintendo Switch.;Dan Starkey, like just about everyone, loves a satisfying platformer. He spent a total of nine hours tracking treasure on this adventure: seven for the single player mode with added stages and chapters and another two spent in co-op.
Fighting EX Layer Review: One-On-One Fun;8;Great; Fighting EX Layer is a no-frills package, but the combat is top-notch.;The mid-to-late '90s were a golden era for fighting games, and Heidi's been playing them since their heyday. She put roughly 15 hours with Fighting EX Layer, playing lots of matches with locally and online to come to grips with the game's nuances‰Û_though she still feels like there's plenty left to learn.
Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus Nintendo Switch Review;8;Great; Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus is still the same great game on Nintendo Switch, but only if you play it in docked mode.;Kallie first reviewed Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus last year. She played seven hours of The New Colossus on Nintendo Switch
Yoku‰Ûªs Island Express Review: A Breath of Fresh Air;9;Superb; The unique blend of Metroid and pinball makes Yoku‰Ûªs Island Express as entertaining as it is charming.;While he normally loves RPGs and single-player games, Alexander had a blast pushing a colourful ball of dung, playing make-shift pinball, and delivering mail as a proud employee of Yoku‰Ûªs Island Express. Over 10 hours was spent playing on the PC, all of which involved flinging poor Yoku around the stunningly beautiful Mokumana Island.
Quarantine Circular Review: Who Are We Really?;7;Good; Quarantine Circular asks fascinating questions about humanity in a well-written narrative adventure, but it struggles to stick the landing.;Alessandro sought to save humanity at any cost in Quarantine Circular and met some unforgettable people along the way during his two-hour playthrough. He also returned to see how some other decisions might have worked out to satisfy his curiosity. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game.
Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection Review - Keep The Past Alive;8;Great; The new Street Fighter collection ensures the series' most influential chapters are here to stay.;Peter tested every game in the collection but spent most of his time playing two of his favorite fighting games of all time, Street Fighter Alpha 3 and Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike. Capcom provided GameSpot with complimentary copies of the game on all platforms.
20XX Review - Robot Generation;7;Good; 20XX's great gameplay is let down by inconsistent procedural level designs and underwhelming boss battles.;Alessandro jumped, shot, and dashed his way through randomly devious levels for over eight hours, mixing things up with both Nina and Ace throughout. He learned to really despise corridors filled with deadly icicles. Code was provided for the purposes of this review.
Rainbow Skies Review: Rainbow in the Dark;5;Mediocre; A stuffy follow-up to Rainbow Moon that doesn't improve on its predecessor.;James O'Connor was quite fond of Rainbow Moon, so he's disappointed that he didn't enjoy Rainbow Skies more. Review code was provided by the publisher, and the game was played across PS4 and PS Vita, often well into the morning.
BlazBlue: Cross Tag Battle Review - The Tag Team Dream;9;Superb; The wonderful worlds of BlazBlue, Persona 4, Under Night, and RWBY collide for an accessible yet challenging fighting showcase.;Michael threw hands in BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger and Chrono Phantasma, but pursued his true self in Persona 4 Arena and Arena Ultimax. Persona means the world to him, so seeing his best friends from Inaba brings him more joy than you can imagine. Cross-Tag Battle's story mode was completed to 100% across all episodes, and countless matches were fought locally and online with the PS4 and Switch versions. Arc System Works provided complimentary copies of the game for review.
The Forest Review: Are You Afraid Of The Dark?;8;Great; The Forest's survival mechanics are captivating, but its unforgettable horrors steal the show.;"Alessandro spent over 24 hours crafting his settlement on The Forest's cannibal-infested island. He spent many of those hours building traps to defend his home, and more than he'd like to admit cowering in the shadows. ""Armsy"" the cave monster still scares him that much."
Dillon's Dead-Heat Breakers Review: Running On Fumes;6;Fair; Dillon's Dead-Heat Breakers has some fantastic moments, but it more often succumbs to mundanity.;Dan Starkey still remembers the Golden Age of tower defense games. Whether it was desktop tower defense, the neat tron-inspired laser fields, or the more modern, big-budget iterations like Defense Grid, Starkey loved them all. He spent about 22 hours playing through all the side quests and the 15 main missions in Dead-heat Breakers. He was provided a copy of the game by the Nintendo for the purposes of this review.
Framed Collection Review - Worth A Thousand Words;7;Good; Unique smartphone games Framed and Framed 2 are now together in one place and offer some fun, clever puzzles.;James O'Connor had previously played both games on smartphone, but was happy to play them through again on Switch--and test the PC version--to see how they held up. GameSpot was provided with review code for both versions.
Hyrule Warriors: Definitive Edition Review - The Great Zelda Spin-Off Is Back;8;Great; Hyrule Warriors: Definitive Edition  on Switch brings all the DLC from other platforms together for what is, in essence, a remaster of one of the best Zelda spin-offs.;Dan Starkey put about 16 hours into this raucous affair. Spending about two hours in multiplayer, and the rest pressing through the single player maps. He received a copy the game from the publisher prior to release.
Agony Review: A Captivating Disappointment;3;Bad; Despite some glorious and gruesome horror imagery, Agony doesn't have much else to offer.;Justin Clark spent 11 hours in Agony. A complimentary review code was provided by the developer.
Golem Review: Hidden In Plain Sight;5;Mediocre; Golem‰Ûªs gorgeous presentation is undercut by poorly designed puzzles and frustrating navigation.;Alessandro spent over eight hours exploring this stunning world with his new golem buddy. He also spent far too much time clicking away at the environment to determine what was actually part of each puzzle. Complimentary code was provided for the purposes of this review.
Pillars Of Eternity 2: Deadfire Review - A Pirate's Life For Me;8;Great; Ship management and naval battles fit neatly into the dark fantasy setting of Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire.;Dan Starkey‰Ûªs a DnD and CRPG obsessive. He has fond memories of late nights by the glow of a CRT, probing the secrets of Knights of the Old Republic‰Ûªs Ebonhawk, or the imaginative levels of Planescape Torment. He spent the better part of 55 hours in the Deadfire Archipelago over the course of a week. Code was provided by the publisher for the purposes of review.
Vampyr Review: The City That Never Sleeps;7;Good; Dontnod follows up Life Is Strange with a surprisingly enthralling supernatural thriller.;Justin Clark gave about 48 hours over to the dark embrace on PS4, and further testing of the PC version was handled by GameSpot staff. A complimentary copy of the game was provided for review.
Detroit: Become Human Review - To Err Is Human;7;Good; Detroit: Become Human presents a gripping tale that's occasionally sullied by blatant missteps.;Peter completed Detroit in a weekend, and despite doing his best to go back and replay old sections while making new decisions, he stopped short of replaying too many chapters in order to preserve the impact of the story he experienced the first time through. Sony provided GameSpot with complimentary copies of the game.
FAR: Lone Sails Review: Come Sail Away;8;Great; A meditative, breezy puzzle adventure game that's light on challenge, but likely to stick with you after you finish it.;James O'Connor spent three hours getting unexpectedly attached to the ship in FAR: Lone Sails before hitting the end credits. Code was provided to GameSpot for review.
Battletech Review: A Tactical PC Game That Will Mech Your Day;8;Great; Battletech's brand of mechanized tactics is as deep as it is slow. But with patience and attention, its detailed mechanics and tonal presentation are incredibly rewarding.;Edmond Tran shamefully owns two big-box copies of Heavy Gear for some reason. He has spent over 35 hours with Battletech so far. This might just be the last time he uses a review bio to request a spiritual successor to Front Mission 3.
Runner 3 Review: A Bit Of A Trip;7;Good; Runner 3 is the most ambitious in the series yet--and also the toughest.;Justin Clark spent eight hours with Runner 3, completing the main stages in five hours. A review code was provided by the publisher.
State Of Decay 2 Review: The Limping Dead;5;Mediocre; State of Decay 2 implements some interesting mechanics but fails to engage with them in a meaningful way.;Alessandro pummeled over 1000 zombies and eradicated all those pesky Plague Hearts in his pursuit to see a hopeful future. He also spent some time with new communities and alternative starting areas. Code was provided by Microsoft for the purposes of this review.
Destiny 2: Warmind Review - Back To Work;6;Fair; Destiny 2: Warmind is geared toward high-level players, but it offers little in the way of motivation while you grind levels to get to the endgame.;Kallie finished Warmind's campaign in about two hours, including detours to grind a few Milestones. She then messed around in Strikes, Escalation Protocols, and more to try out her new-and-improved exotics. She is really loving the changes to Riskrunner.
Wizard Of Legend Review: Fast-Paced Action;7;Good; The fast movement and skillful action of Wizard of Legend sets it apart among a sea of indie roguelikes.;Heidi has played a whole mess of roguelikes. She's also played a whole mess of action-RPGs and overhead action games. So when a game came along combining all of those... well, she jumped at it. She's still trying to collect some of the spells and artifacts, but she put a lot of time into exploring Wizard of Legend.
Battle Chasers Nightwar Review: Switch It Up;8;Great; Justin Clark spent 50 hours with Battle Chasers on its original release, and an additional 20 between the Switch and the current version on PS4. It was not till his ...;Justin Clark spent 50 hours with Battle Chasers on its original release, and an additional 20 between the Switch and the current version on PS4. It was not till his current playthrough that he realized he was saying ‰ÛÏNO! MONIKA!‰Û like Ja Rule in The Fast and the Furious whenever Red Monika died in-game. A code for the Switch version was provided by the developer, and the PC and Xbox One versions were tested by GameSpot staff.
Conan Exiles Review: Dull And Dense;3;Bad; This hardcore survival sim is too dense for its own good.;Having spent over 40 hours building, climbing, and trudging through the exiled lands, James Swinbanks is looking forward to getting home and having a hot shower. He spent over 40 hours playing across PC and Xbox using both PC code purchased during Early Access and Xbox code provided by the publisher for review purposes.
Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze Review - A Blast From The Past;9;Superb; Tropical Freeze is another wonderful Donkey Kong Country game, and it's better than ever on Switch.;Peter completed Tropical Freeze as Donkey Kong and surfed through a couple worlds as Funky Kong before writing his review. Nintendo provided GameSpot with a complimentary copy of the game.
Jotun: Valhalla Edition Switch Review - A Slight Downgrade;7;Good; Jaw dropping beauty and a hefty challenge await you in in the hallowed realm of Jotun.;With no small amount of luck, and hundreds of deaths, Justin Clark was able to complete Jotun‰Ûªs campaign. To his dismay, Chris Hemsworth was not the final boss. In addition to playing Jotun on PC, PS4, and Xbox one back in 2015, Justin spent a couple hours with the Switch version for this updated review.
Nintendo Labo Review: Variety Kit And Robot Kit;7;Good; Nintendo Labo is a great tool for learning and creation, but the games themselves lack lasting appeal.;Kallie spent around 25 hours building the Variety Kit's Toy-Cons, playing their games, learning how they work, and then trying her hand at making a Toy-Con game herself. She then spent another 5 with the Robot Kit. Complimentary kits were provided for the purposes of this review.
City of Brass Review - Hidden Treasure;7;Good; City of Brass may not be solid gold, but the luster of its well-balanced gameplay loop makes it worth a look.;Alexander spent many hours fighting skeletons, avoiding floor spikes, and bribing genies in order to conquer the City of Brass. GameSpot was provided a complimentary PS4 copy of the game for this review.
The Invisible Hours Review: From Every Angle;7;Good; The Invisible Hours is less about solving a murder and more about appreciating the interwoven stories of its compelling characters.;Kallie spent 10 hours playing The Invisible Hours on Xbox One, following every character through each chapter to get the full picture. A complimentary code was provided for the purposes of this review.
Total War Saga: Thrones Of Britannia Review - Rule Britannia;8;Great; Total War Saga: Thrones of Britannia makes a hearty meal out of pig-sticking, pillaging, and politics.;Ginny Woo leans towards military carnage of a distinctly Warhammer flavor, but now and again she craves some good, old-fashioned historical intrigue. For the purposes of this review, Ginny spent 40 hours putting out the flames of rebellion across all the major cultural groups, granting divorces, and putting traitors to the sword. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game by Sega.
Fortnite: Battle Royale Review - Laying The Foundation;8;Great; Fortnite: Battle Royale offers lots of depth with a fun and unique take on the last-person-standing premise.;Michael has completed a battle royale trifecta having reviewed PUBG, H1Z1, and now Fortnite. He was totally on that wave before everyone else (pinky up) with early ARMA mods and H1Z1: King of the Kill. He put over 40 hours in Fortnite: Battle Royale for review, and a majority of that time was spent on the PC version, although time went into the PS4 and Xbox One versions as well. He provided his own copy of the game, since it's free.
Frostpunk Review: Damned If You Do Damned If You Don't;9;Superb; Frostpunk is a brutal city-survival sim that thrives on forcing you to make tough choices in harrowing scenarios.;Dan Starkey‰Ûªs a big fan of building cities. Starting with SimCity 3000 Unlimited, he‰Ûªs been building up all kinds of municipalities, hoping that they will stand the test of time. He was provided with a copy by the publisher for the purposes of this review and managed to complete two of three main scenarios over 25 hours (in the last one, all his people froze to death. RIP.)
Extinction Review - A Giant Mess;4;Poor; Extinction is a clumsy and frustrating game that struggles to put its potential to good use.;Peter finished Extinction's story mode on PS4 and did further testing on Xbox One and PC before writing his review. Complimentary copies of the game were provided by the publisher.
God Of War Review: Out With The Old In With The New;9;Superb; God of War is every bit the over-the-top action game you expect, but it's the story and setting that end up stealing the show.;Peter completed God of War's story in roughly 30 hours before writing his review. He's eagerly continuing his search for greater treasure and more powerful opponents. GameSpot was provided with complimentary copies of the game by Sony.
The Alliance Alive Review: A Change Of Pace;8;Great; Good pacing, engaging mechanics, and an interesting setting help make The Alliance Alive a noteworthy RPG.;Heidi‰Ûªs been playing JRPGs practically since she could hold a controller. She spent about 35 hours with The Alliance Alive on her playthrough for this review, but she‰Ûªs strongly considering going through it again.
Life Is Strange: Before The Storm Review - Keep the Good Times Rolling;8;Great; Before the Storm is an impactful prequel that accomplishes something very different than the original Life is Strange.;Justin Clark completed Before The Storm and its bonus episodes in about 6 hours. A season pass was provided by the publisher.
Penny-Punching Princess Review: In For A Pound;6;Fair; Penny-Punching Princess is a solid, often fun brawler, but its emphasis on grinding and repetition make it too easy to step away from.;James O'Connor appreciates the irony of playing a game about a princess with a complicated relationship with money purely so he can write a review and get paid for it. Review code for this game was provided by the publisher.
MLB The Show 18 Review: A Home Run;9;Superb; MLB The Show 18 controls like a dream, and is the best-looking baseball game ever made.;Eddie spent more than a dozen hours across all of MLB The Show 18's modes. He nearly threw two no-hitters, one of which was broken up with two outs in the ninth. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game by Sony.
The Swords Of Ditto Review: One Good Turn Deserves Another;7;Good; This compact action-RPG will charm you for days on end.;James Swinbanks is a game reviewer by day and cartoon superhero by night. He spent 35 hours with The Swords of Ditto across PC and PS4, using codes provided by Devolver Digital.
Orwell: Ignorance Is Strength Review - Staunch Surveillance;6;Fair; The follow-up to Orwell, which asks you to take down an anti-government blogger, is a slighter take on the original game's mechanics and themes.;Since reviewing the original Orwell for GameSpot, James O'Connor finally got around to reading Animal Farm (it's very good). He spent 5 hours playing and then revisiting Orwell: Ignorance is Strength. Code was provided by the publisher.
Far Cry 5 Review: Rocky Mountain High;9;Superb; With some smart changes to exploration, discovery, and progression, Far Cry 5 makes engaging and experimenting with its gorgeous open world more exciting than ever.;Edmond Tran is an Australian who has road-tripped across America's rural south, but has never been to Montana. He thinks Far Cry 2 had all the best ideas. Far Cry 5 was reviewed on a PS4 Pro. Additional testing of the PC and Xbox One versions were handled by GameSpot staff. Copies of the game were provided by Ubisoft.
Kerbal Space Program: Making History Review - Shoot For The Mun;7;Good; Kerbal Space Program's first expansion brings a universe of new possibilities, but it might be a little behind in the space race.;Justin Clark gave the Making History expansion 35 hours, on top of the 120 he's poured into the base game since it officially released. He's pretty sure this means he has a Bachelor's in Astrophysics now. A review code was provided by the publisher.
Yakuza 6: The Song Of Life Review: Tokyo Drifter;8;Great; Exciting changes to combat and an endearing narrative see the final chapter in Kazuma Kiryu's decade-long saga refine what has made the series great.;Edmond Tran has been an ardent fan of the Yakuza series since 2006. He spent around 65 hours completing literally everything Yakuza 6: The Song of Life has to offer, and all he got was a lousy Platinum trophy. The game was provided by the publisher.
Minit Review - Gone In 60 Seconds;8;Great; Minit might impose a daunting time limit on each of your lives, but its cleverly designed world and enriched puzzles make the cycle of exploration and death well worth investing ...;Alessandro spent well over three hours chopping down trees, finding coins, fighting scorpions and going on treacherous fishing trips across two playthroughs on PS4, including New Game+.

Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice Review;8;Great; Hellblade is a spellbinding and sympathetic game about loss and redemption.;Alessandro finished Hellblade's story in about 8 hours on hard mode. Playing on the PC, he was able to clear through the initial playthrough of the game without experiencing permadeath. The GameSpot staff also played through the game on PS4 and PS4 Pro. GameSpot was provided complimentary codes by developer and publisher Ninja Theory for the purpose of this review. Also, DmC: Devil May Cry was a great game.
A Way Out Review: You Can't Have One Without The Other;6;Fair; A Way Out is a unique, enjoyable adventure that has a number of problems.;Oscar and GameSpot senior video producer Adam Mason were forced to sit next to one another for around eight hours while playing A Way Out. They enjoyed both the game and each other's company (mostly). EA provided GameSpot with a complimentary copy of the game for review.
Sea Of Thieves Review: Set Sail With Trepidation;6;Fair; Sea of Thieves' promising foundation is muddied by shallow quests and the pervasive cynicism of other players.;Peter sunk roughly 30 hours into Sea of Thieves before tying up his sails, and he hopes to revisit the game down the road if Rare can build on its more enticing aspects. GameSpot was provided with complimentary copies by Microsoft.
Ni No Kuni 2: Revenant Kingdom Review - A Regal Joyride;8;Great; Ni No Kuni 2's adorable exterior masks the impressive RPG within.;Peter completed Ni No Kuni 2's story in 35 hours, which included a few hours dedicated solely to developing his new kingdom. Bandai-Namco provided GameSpot with a complimentary copy of the game for review.

Surviving Mars Review: Building The Final Frontier;8;Great; Surviving Mars tasks you with leading humanity's first colonies on the Red Planet. But Mars is hardly forgiving, and it will fight you every step of the way.;Starkey has been fascinated by space since childhood. He started a dozen colonies, abandoning the first eight to the swirling clouds of dust on the Red Planet. He brought the other four up to self-sufficient state, taking them into the late game. An early code was provided by the developer for this review.
Detective Pikachu Review: Elementary My Dear Watt-son;7;Good; Detective Pikachu's simple gameplay and story is made better by its goofy and entertaining star.;It took Kallie 12 hours to finish Detective Pikachu's story. She was very happy that Trubbish made an appearance. A complimentary code was provided for the purposes of this review.
Mulaka Review: Of Myth And Monsters;7;Good; A magical setting and engaging gameplay make Mulaka a worthwhile adventure.;Jason D'Aprile spent around ten hours exploring the magical world of Mulaka using a copy of the game provided by the developer.
Batman: The Enemy Within Episode 5 Review - No More Joking Around;9;Superb; Telltale finishes strong with an introspective look at the relationship between Batman and Joker.;Tamoor now wants a series in which he can play as Joker the vigilante, if only to use the chattering teeth grapnel. GameSpot was provided with a code for this review.
H1Z1 Review: Still On The Ground Floor;6;Fair; In many ways, H1Z1 still captures the magic of battle royale games, but there isn't enough to make it stand out from the competition.;Michael is a veteran of battle royale games, having poured dozens of hours into the earlier Arma 2 mods and H1Z1: King of the Kill. He also reviewed PUBG for GameSpot and became a sort of Fortnite expert on accident. He spent a little over 30 hours with the 1.0 release of H1Z1.
Pit People Review;7;Good;" The Behemoth's turn-based strategy game carries the studio's usual sense of humor and a fun PokÌ©mon-style ""catch 'em all"" twist.";James O'Connor thinks that this genre peaked at Fire Emblem Awakening and would have loved to have married off the weird monsters and even weirder humans on his team. He spent 16 hours with Pit People using a code provided by the publisher.
Q.U.B.E. 2 Review: Think Inside The Box;7;Good; Q.U.B.E. 2 presents satisfyingly complex puzzles, but a messy narrative underpins its lack of personality.;Alessandro rotated, created, and levitated all sorts of colourful blocks over his six hour stay within Q.U.B.E. 2's mysterious alien artifact. A complimentary code was provided by Toxic Games for review.
Kirby Star Allies Review: Take It Easy;8;Great; With heaps of personality and invaluable extra content, Kirby Star Allies rises to greatness.;Peter breezed through story mode in about five hours, walking away with over 100 extra lives. Another couple hours were spent cleaning up puzzle pieces, and in the speedrun and boss rush modes. Nintendo provided GameSpot with a complimentary copy of the game for review.
Bravo Team Review: Back To Basics;4;Poor; Though VR co-op is a nice touch, Bravo Team brings nothing else new to the table.;Justin Clark spent three hours with Bravo Team's campaign and an additional 2 was spent in co-op. A code was provided by the publisher.
The 25th Ward: The Silver Case Review: Obstruction Of Justice;6;Fair; The 25th Ward's splintered narrative will frustrate and confuse, but also fascinate.;Justin Clark completed every episode in The 25th Ward in just over 20 hours. Not coincidentally, he has refused to go to an ATM all week. A complimentary review code was provided by NIS America.
Payday 2 Switch Review: Mo' Money Mo' Problems;5;Mediocre; Marred by compromise, Payday 2 on Switch pales in comparison to other versions.;James Swinbanks is a world-renowned criminal mastermind said to be living in an underwater palace in the Pacific Ocean he built using his stolen millions. He spent just over 20 hours with Payday 2 using a code provided by Starbreeze Studios for review purposes.
Gravel Review: Slow And Steady Doesn't Win The Race;5;Mediocre; Gravel's arcade sensibilities conjure occasional moments of flat out fun, but unimaginative track design and a lack of depth means most races are just dull.;Richard spent roughly 15 hours on Gravel‰Ûªs uneven tracks, using a complimentary copy of the game provided by the publisher.
Moss Review: Tiny Triumph;8;Great; Moss makes it easy for you to connect to its adventurous, adorable protagonist as you accompany her on a whimsical journey though a surprisingly inventive platformer.;Alessandro and Quill explored every inch of Moss' world they could find over a period of four hours, taking in the sights and hunting down some collectibles during their adventure. A code was provided by Sony for the purposes of review.
Where The Water Tastes Like Wine Review: Hard Travelin';6;Fair; A unique game about collecting and trading stories across the American Dust Bowl doesn't give much room to craft your own story in the process.;James O'Connor isn't an American (he's Australian, in fact), but he loves a good story. He spent 12 hours reaching the conclusion of Where the Water Tastes Like Wine, code for which was provided by the publisher.
Pac-Man: Championship Edition 2 Review;8;Great; Pac-Man: Championship Edition 2 builds on the success of its predecessor, reinvigorating classic Pac-Man gameplay with new mechanics and eye-catching visuals.;Jason D‰ÛªAprile has been gobbling dots with Pac-Man since the beginning, and after around 6 hours with this new Pac, he expects to continue doing so until well into the future. GameSpot was provided with complimentary download codes for the purpose of this review.
Metal Gear Survive Review: Too Harsh To Enjoy;5;Mediocre; Metal Gear Survive's punishing systems drag down what could have been a good survival game for PS4, Xbox One, and PC.;Tamoor is lifelong Metal Gear fan. He still plays Metal Gear Solid 5 at least once a week, and Survive has been an interesting shock to the system for him. GameSpot was supplied with a complimentary code to conduct its review.
Bridge Constructor Portal Review;4;Poor; Bridge Constructor Portal lacks the charm and cleverness that made the original Portal games so enthralling.;Until a bug halted his progress at test chamber 50, Tom spent 25 hours building bridges and saving stickmen using a complimentary Switch copy of the game provided to GameSpot.
Fe Review: Strike A Chord;7;Good; Fe's ethereal world compels you to explore, but its adventure never builds to something greater.;
Aegis Defenders Review;4;Poor; Platforming and tower defense do not mix well in Aegis Defenders.;Oscar jumped gaps, placed turrets, and shot enemies in Aegis Defenders for around 20 hours. A complimentary code was supplied to GameSpot for the purposes of this review.
Age Of Empires: Definitive Edition Review: Antique Revival;6;Fair; Age of Empires: Definitive Edition introduces gameplay tweaks and 4K visuals to a 20-year old classic, but not everything holds up to modern standards.;Dan Starkey's been playing Age of Empires almost since its inception. While he (like many) started with Age of Kings, he's since developed a perplexing passion for each of the quirky games in the series--yes, even Age of Mythology. He received a pre-release code from the publisher for the purposes of this review.
Attack Of The Earthlings Review: The Tables Have Turned;7;Good; Attack of the Earthlings is a humorous, inverted take on the familiar alien invasion story, packaged within a decent turn-based strategy game.;Daniel Starkey survived the human invasion, expelling the intruders in about 10 hours. He was provided with code by the publisher for the purposes of this review.
Rust Review: Life Is Fleeting;3;Bad; Rust's dated survival mechanics and overwhelmingly unwelcoming player base make it an experience more interesting to talk about than actually play.;Alessandro spent over 30 hours hitting a rock against a bigger rock only to have his handful of stones stolen by a roving band of armed militia. GameSpot received a complementary code from Facepunch Studios.
Bayonetta 2 Review;10;Essential; Bayonetta 2 is a classic, and one of the finest, most wonderfully insane action games ever made.;Mark adored the original Bayonetta, but even all that time spent with Platinum Games' classic didn't prepare him for just how wonderful its sequel would be. He completed Bayonetta 2's story mode, beat all the challenges, and continues to try and uncover the game's many secrets.
Kingdom Come: Deliverance Review: The Past Comes At You Fast;8;Great; Kingdom Come: Deliverance offers enthralling medieval history alongside demanding systems and troublesome bugs.;Brett spent 40 hours (on PC) in the feudal pleasures and pitfalls of the Holy Roman Empire as depicted in Kingdom Come: Deliverance. Additional testing of the PS4 and Xbox One versions were handled by GameSpot staff. All versions were complimentary copies provided by the publisher.
Dandara Review: Off The Wall;7;Good; Dandara‰Ûªs inventive movement mechanics help keep this sometimes frustrating platformer afloat.;Tom took more than 10 hours to play through Dandara using a Switch copy provided by the publisher. He explored 98% of the map but found a mere 77% of the treasure chests.
Secret Of Mana Review: Where Secrets Go Trouble Follows;6;Fair; The Secret of Mana remake is mostly the same game you know and love, for better and for worse.;Justin Clark put 22 hours into Secret of Mana, finally settling an angry, twenty-year grudge against Thunder Gigas in the process. A complimentary code was provided by the publisher.
Civilization 6: Rise And Fall Review: A New Era;8;Great; Rise and Fall introduces smart new features to Civ VI that enhance the base game without overcomplicating it.;Kallie played two full games in Rise and Fall, winning a science victory as Korea and a culture victory as the Cree. She experimented with a few of the other new civs before deciding that Korea is her new go-to. A complimentary copy was provided for the purposes of this review.
Dynasty Warriors 9 Review: A New World;7;Good; A new open world breathes life into this ancient franchise.;Belying his usual peaceful nature, James Swinbanks spent nearly 50 hours carving through and laying waste to thousands of soldiers with a complimentary copy of Dynasty Warriors 9, provided by Koei Tecmo for the purposes of this review.
Dissidia Final Fantasy NT Review: A Messy Mashup;5;Mediocre; Square-Enix and Team Ninja have brought its popular arcade-fighter Dissidia Final Fantasy to the home platform, but it unfortunately isn't able to live up to the series it seeks to ...;Alessandro is long-time fan of the Final Fantasy series, and has clocked in over 70 hours in Dissidia 012 [Duodecim] on the PSP. Though he enjoyed combat in Dissidia Final Fantasy NT, he was disappointed with how much less content there was to dive into. Square-Enix provided a complimentary code for the game for the purposes of our coverage.
Dragon Quest Builders Review: Working The Land;8;Great; A clever concept begets outstanding execution as the world of the original Dragon Quest is reimagined as a riveting sandbox.;Miguel needed 50 hours to complete Dragon Quest Builders' campaign, a playthrough that also included free-roaming for optional treasures. He spent an additional five hours on the Vita version. Review codes for both platforms were provided by Square Enix in advance of release. This review gave Miguel an unsurprising hankering to replay the original Dragon Quest.
Shadow Of The Colossus Review: A Timeless Classic;9;Superb; Shadow of the Colossus is a beautiful reconstruction of an extraordinary title, a modern classic that everyone must experience.;Edmond Tran still remembers the day he bought the PAL cardboard sleeve version of Shadow of the Colossus for PlayStation 2 over a decade ago. He cherishes it, and even kept the original shrink wrap because that's not a weird, obsessive thing to do at all. He patted Agro about 87 times in this remake with a copy provided by SCE.
Crossing Souls Review: Stuck In The Past;6;Fair; Crossing Souls is a serviceable action-adventure fueled by 1980s nostalgia, but its dependence on classic tropes isn't enough to make it remarkable.;Edmond Tran's life is full of non-stop 80s music weekends, and he also shares Chris' unique ability to climb ladders. Crossing Souls was completed in approximately 7 hours using a copy provided by the publisher.
Radiant Historia Perfect Chronology Review: Time After Time After Time;8;Great; A seemingly novel time-travel mechanic shows depth in this engrossing 3DS enhanced port of a Nintendo DS RPG.;Miguel spent 60 hours on the story, which also included sessions in the Vault of Time. A code was provided by Atlus for review purposes.
Night In The Woods Review;9;Superb; Night in the Woods delivers an evocative take on the early-20s existential crisis with awkward humor and charming characters.;Kallie took 12 hours to play through Night in the Woods using a complimentary copy provided to GameSpot. She successfully raised the baby rats.
The Longest Five Minutes Review: The Power Of Memories;6;Fair; The Longest Five Minutes‰Ûª intriguing premise and charming visual style is hampered by poor design elements.;Heidi put about 15 hours into The Longest Five Minutes, completing and re-completing several quests and investigating multiple story branches. NIS America provided GameSpot with a complimentary copy of the game for review.
OK K.O.! Let's Play Heroes Review: Pulling Punches;6;Fair; OK K.O. Let's Play Heroes perfectly captures the tone of the show, but the shallow mechanics prove to be its kryptonite.;Instead of going out and doing heroic deeds, Alexander spent many hours playing superhero in the OK K.O. universe instead. GameSpot was provided a complimentary PC copy of the game for this review.
UFC 3 Review: A Tense Exciting And Dynamic Recreation Of MMA;8;Great; UFC 3's overhauled striking is wince-inducingly brilliant, but its cumbersome grappling continues to lag behind.;If the grappling in EA Sports UFC series ever catches up to the striking, Richard might finally stop wishing for a new Fight Night. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game by EA.
Owlboy Review: A Heartfelt Tale;9;Superb; Owlboy's touching story is brought to life through beautiful art and an unforgettable soundtrack.;Peter kept his eye on Owlboy for years and was thrilled when he discovered that good things indeed come to those who wait. He completed the campaign in roughly 10 hours using a copy of the game provided by developer D-Pad Studio.
Subnautica Review: A Water Wonderland;9;Superb; Subnautica is a terrifying, mystifying, massive, and brilliant survival game.;Brett spent around 40 hours swimming and scaring himself stupid amidst the reefs, wrecks, and alien ruins of Subnautica. The game was reviewed using a complimentary copy provided by the developer.
The Inpatient Review;8;Great; A rare prequel that actually enhances its predecessor, The Inpatient takes a subtle but effective approach to psychological horror in VR.;Justin Clark played through The Inpatient three separate times over seven hours, achieving three different outcomes. He spent 25 minutes using the voice function to verbally berate Dr. Bragg. A code was provided by the publisher.
Celeste Review: More Than Just A Great Platformer;9;Superb; Celeste is a difficult, powerful, rewarding adventure.;Oscar completed Celeste's main campaign in a little under seven hours, but the adventure within will stay with him for much, much longer. Matt Makes Games provided GameSpot with complimentary copies of Celeste for the purposes of this review.
Gorogoa Review;8;Great; Gorogoa provides a beautiful and clever trip through surreal art.;Jason played through Gorogoa on Nintendo Switch using a complimentary copy of the game provided by Annapurna Interactive. GameSpot provided additional testing on PC.
The Red Strings Club Review;9;Superb; The Red Strings Club is a deeply gratifying cyberpunk adventure whose strong writing and exciting scenarios enhance its themes about the manipulation of human emotion.;David Rayfield has made some questionable choices in bars in the middle of the night. Fortunately, only a few have led to him attempting to bring down global corporations. The Red Strings Club was reviewed on PC. A copy of the game was provided by the publisher.
Iconoclasts Review;9;Superb; Iconoclasts captivates with over-the-top battles and a riveting story.;Matt jumped into Iconoclasts completely unaware that it had been in development since 2010. He's a big fan of Metroidvania games and spent 13 hours playing through the adventure. Suffice to say, he enjoyed every second of it. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy for the purposes of this review.
PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds Review;8;Great; Despite glaring technical flaws, PUBG emerges as the most thrilling battle royal game to date.;Michael is a veteran of battle royale games, having poured dozens of hours into the earlier Arma II mods and H1Z1: King of the Kill. He spent over 150 hours in PUBG in early access, and he, with help from other GameSpot staff, put further testing into version 1.0 before finalizing his review. He's eating good now with all them chicken dinners.
Hello Neighbor Review;3;Bad; Hello Neighbor seems inviting at the outset, but its clumsy, obtuse approach to stealth will have you searching for the exit.;Justin Clark spent seven hours with Hello Neighbor, in both its Early Access and post-release versions. A code was provided by the publisher.
L.A. Noire: The VR Case Files Review;8;Great; LA Noire VR shows that Rockstar has a deep respect and passion for virtual reality.;Jimmy completed the VR version of LA Noire in roughly seven hours on the HTC Vive. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game for the purpose of this review.
AO Tennis Review;3;Bad; With more errors (forced and unforced) than winners, AO Tennis is a disappointing return to the tennis game world.;Rather than play the real thing, Alexander spent countless tennis matches worth of time playing AO Tennis. GameSpot was provided a complimentary PS4 copy of the game for this review.
Lost Sphear Review: Short Of The Mark;6;Fair; Tokyo RPG Factory's follow-up to I Am Setsuna improves on the first game's combat, but feels like a by-the-numbers RPG in other areas.;James O'Connor spent most of the 30 hours it took to finish Lost Sphear thinking about Chrono Trigger, and how long it has been since he last played through it. GameSpot was provided with a PS4 code for review.
Tiny Metal Review;7;Good; Tiny Metal brings accessible turn-based military strategy back into the spotlight;Justin Clark was able to get through Tiny Metal's campaign on PC in about 6 hours, and he spent another 4 in Skirmish stages. The Switch port was also tested, and is the first game to drag him away from Mario Odyssey since October. Review codes were provided by the publisher.
Spellforce 3 Review;7;Good; RPG and RTS join together for the somewhat unwieldy but still engaging SpellForce III.;Brett spent around 30 hours exploring dungeons and building bases in SpellForce III. Complimentary review code was provided by the publisher.
Brawlout Review;5;Mediocre; Brawlout is a Smash Bros.-like fighting game that's equal parts admirable and frustrating.;Heidi has played a fair bit of Smash, and while she's by no means a competitive expert at the game, she's played enough Smash-likes to know what works and what doesn't. Heidi unlocked as much as she could playing Brawlout over the course of a week while also trying to get in online matches. A review code was provided by the developer.
Destiny 2: Curse Of Osiris Review;5;Mediocre; Destiny 2's first DLC expansion, Curse of Osiris, adds lots of filler and little substance.;Kallie played 15 hours of Curse of Osiris and had the most fun with the very broken Prometheus Lens. She played on PS4 using a copy of Destiny 2 provided by Bungie.
Doom VFR Review;7;Good; Doom's trademark demon slaying translates well to virtual reality, but Doom VFR feels more like a warning shot than a BFG blast.;Justin Clark played through Doom VFR‰Ûªs campaign in 4 hours on PSVR. He was looking forward to fistbumping the little Doomguy bobbleheads in VR, dangit. A review code was provided by Bethesda.
Batman: The Enemy Within - Episode 4: What Ails You Review;9;Superb; Telltale puts Bruce Wayne and John Doe's relationship under the microscope in the strongest episode of the Batman: The Enemy Within.;Tamoor thinks everyone deserves a chance, even The Joker. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game for the purpose of this review.
Street Fighter 5: Arcade Edition Review;9;Superb; A variety of offline modes, a fresh coat of paint, and a big new gameplay addition gives Street Fighter V a new lease on life.;Tamoor is now having to split time between Street Fighter V and Overwatch, and it's proving to be very difficult. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game for the purpose of this review.
Rumu Review;7;Good; Rumu combines some superb character work and heady sci-fi themes into a heart-wrenching story about love, family, and loneliness.;He may not be as cute or affectionate as Rumu, but Alexander Pan can clean the heck out of spilled tea and toast, and would gladly do so again. GameSpot was provided a complimentary copy of the game for this review.
The Legend of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild - The Champions' Ballad Review;8;Great; The Champions' Ballad is a satisfying send-off for one of the year's best games.;Peter completed every quest in The Champions' Ballad before writing his review. Nintendo provided a complimentary Breath of the Wild expansion pass to GameSpot.
GT Sport Review;8;Great; GT Sport's refined multiplayer racing makes up for a relatively small selection of cars and tracks.;After nearly 50 hours of racing, including numerous online races and completing the entire campaign mode, James Swinbanks is temporarily hanging up his helmet until the next championship series. His copy of Gran Turismo Sport was provided by Sony.
The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Switch Review;8;Great; A strong foundation and a high-quality port make Skyrim worth revisiting on Switch.;Kallie played ten hours of Skyrim on Switch, playing a sneaky archer (of course). She finally tried magic for the first time in six years and loved it. A complimentary code was provided for the purposes of this review.
Xenoblade Chronicles 2 Review;7;Good; Xenoblade Chronicles 2 is a massive and dense game littered with small issues that hold it back from greatness.;Peter has played both Xenoblade Chronicles and Xenoblade Chronicles X (which he also reviewed), and he put 90 hours into Xenoblade Chronicles 2 before writing his review. He uncovered 18 of the game's 38 rare Blades, and concluded the story at level 65. A complimentary copy of the game was provided by Nintendo.
Football Manager 2018 Review;9;Superb; With a significant new addition and impactful overhauls built atop its already-solid foundations, Football Manager 2018 is every bit the compelling time sink as its predecessors.;Richard spent over 50 hours playing Football Manager 2018
Steep: Road To The Olympics Review;7;Good; Steep's Road to the Olympics expansion features a disappointing story mode, but it has just enough other content to make it still worthwhile.;Alex is an avid skier in real life and has put about 70 hours into Steep. He spent 10 hours in Road to the Olympics, three of which were devoted to the story mode. He reviewed the game on PS4 Pro with a copy provided by the publisher.
Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2 Review;7;Good; It may be formulaic, but Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2 still retains the series' trademark charm and fun.;Randolph completed the game with the assistance of his 8-year-old son, who for some strange reason thought Black Bolt was the best character available. Warner Bros. provided the reviewer with a copy of the game.
LA Noire Switch Review;7;Good; Despite a few technical issues, L.A. Noire is well worth playing on Switch.;Matt played ten hours of L.A. Noire on Switch, managing to clear 11 of the game's 21 main cases. He's a huge fan of film noir
Ashes Cricket Review;7;Good; While it doesn‰Ûªt quite score a century, Ashes Cricket still puts in a decent knock.;It's been a few years since James Swinbanks opened the bowling for Kincumber Cricket Club, but he still knows his Fine Leg from his Long Off. He played Ashes Cricket for 10 hours with a copy provided by the publisher.
Need For Speed Payback Review;5;Mediocre; Dull and uninspired, with a relentless emphasis on grinding, Need for Speed Payback is neither fast nor furious.;Richard reached Payback's ending in 15 hours, and walked away wishing he had played Criterion's Need for Speed Hot Pursuit instead. Additional testing of the Xbox One version was handled by GameSpot staff. EA provided complimentary copies of the game for review.
Sonic Forces Review;5;Mediocre; Sonic Forces consistently fails more than it succeeds, squandering the opportunity to build on the series‰Ûª past successes.;Matt played Sonic Forces for 8 hours and has managed to achieve S-ranks for 22 out of the 30 main stages. His OC is a bird named Jigen, who wears Salt Bae glasses and fingerless gloves (plz dont steal). Matt was a huge fan of 3D Sonic games growing up. His favorite 3D Sonic game remains Sonic Colors. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy for the purposes of this review.
Oure Review;5;Mediocre; Take to the skies as a dragon in Oure, but don't expect to find much to do up there.;James O'Connor took Oure for a spin within moments of its Paris Games Week reveal, and spent about four hours exploring and finishing the game (it would have taken less time if he had not gotten briefly caught up looking for collectables). A copy of the game was purchased by the reviewer.
Steven Universe: Save the Light Review;6;Fair; Grumpyface's second RPG based on Steven Universe is made of love, but it's the bugs that are stronger than you.;Justin Clark was able to clear Save the Light in around 20 hours with 78% completion. May God grant him the courage to one day do a square afro in public like Garnet. Review code was provided by the publisher.
Doom Switch Review;7;Good; Doom remains a blast to play on Switch despite some persistent performance issues.;Peter played ten hours of Doom on Switch heading into his review, splitting his time between the campaign, arcade mode, and multiplayer.

He began at level 45, and finished at level 55. Complimentary code was provided by SCIE.

Etrian Odyssey 5: Beyond The Myth Review;8;Great; Etrian Odyssey 5 further refines a winning dungeon-crawling formula while sticking closely to its roots.;Heidi has played almost every Etrian Odyssey game since the series made its debut a decade ago, and she spent about 60 hours working her way through the Beyond the Myth's main quest. Atlus provided GameSpot with a copy of the game.
Spelunker Party Review;6;Fair; Solo Spelunker Party is an unforgiving grind, but a strong multiplayer component makes for a fun time with retro-minded friends.;Heidi mined her way through a healthy chunk of Spelunker Party, completing the main four worlds of the game and numerous quests.
Rocket League Switch Review;9;Superb; Rocket League survives its conversion to Switch with minimal wear and tear.;Peter has played roughly 200 hours of Rocket League on PS4, and he put in 40 matches on Switch before writing his review. A copy Rocket League was provided by Psyonix.
Hand Of Fate 2 Review;8;Great; A much-improved sequel that blends disparate gameplay styles to create a compelling roguelike experience.;James O'Connor enjoyed the original Hand of Fate, but was far keener on this sequel, which he spent 15 hours with on PC. Somehow, he has never played Dungeons & Dragons. A review code was supplied by the game's developer.
Star Wars Battlefront II Review;6;Fair; The sequel to DICE's 2015 Star Wars game makes some big changes to the formula, but not all are for the better.;Alessandro is an admirer of the Star Wars saga, and played way too much of the original Battlefront on Xbox back in the day. Finishing the new Battlefront II's campaign in 4-5 hours, he was also able to spend quite a bit of time checking out the intense online multiplayer. EA provided a complimentary codes for the purpose of this review.
Megaton Rainfall Review;7;Good; Megaton Rainfall pulls off some feats and squanders others, but one's thing's for sure: there's no other superhero game like it.;Justin Clark was able to complete Megaton Rainfall's primary missions in about four hours, half in and half out of VR. How Lois Lane flies with Superman so much and doesn't hurl up her last three meals is a mystery. A review code was provided by the publisher.
Call Of Duty: WWII Review;9;Superb; Sledgehammer Games superbly takes Activision's marquee shooter franchise back to its boots-on-the-ground roots.;It took Miguel a little over six hours to finish Call of Duty: WWII's campaign, and he spent approximately 20 additional hours progressing through the multiplayer and Zombies modes. This playthrough was experienced on a PlayStation 4 at a four-day Activision-hosted review event in San Francisco.
Batman: The Enemy Within - Episode 3: Fractured Mask Review;8;Great; Telltale digs deep into Bruce Wayne's relationships, as things get complicated for the Dark Knight.;Delving into Batman: The Enemy Within Episode 3 helped Tamoor get over Justice League a bit. GameSpot was provided a code for the purpose of this review.

Super Lucky's Tale Review;6;Fair; Super Lucky's Tale isn't a direct port of its VR predecessor, but it's no less simplistic.;Kallie finished Super Lucky's Tale in about five hours with 100% completion. She also played Lucky's Tale on Oculus Rift. A complimentary code was provided for the purposes of this review.

A season pass was provided by the publisher.
Assassin's Creed Origins Review;7;Good; In charting out a new storyline and the largest setting for the series yet, Assassin's Creed Origins makes a few stumbles along the way.;Alessandro is an admirer of the Assassin's Creed series. Though the series became too convoluted for his tastes, Origins did a lot to win him back with its new formula. Ubisoft invited GameSpot to a review event where they played through the 30 hour campaign for five days on an Xbox One X developer unit.

Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga + Bowser's Minions Review;8;Great; A stunning visual overhaul and subtle gameplay enhancements make this already charming, funny RPG even better.;Heidi spent about 20 hours on the main story of Mario and Luigi and about six to seven hours on the Minion Quest game. She still hates the final boss with a passion. Nintendo provided GameSpot with a complimentary copy of the game for the purpose of this review.
Fire Emblem Warriors Review;6;Fair; Fire Emblem‰Ûªs heroes are a natural fit for a Warriors game, but their world adds little depth to the aging and shallow hack-and-slash series.;After he finished the campaign, Jeremy Winslow spent the majority of his time trying to unlock his favorite Fire Emblem character, Lyndis, and level her up to be the most powerful character in the game. He spent roughly 30 hours with Fire Emblem Warriors using a complimentary copy provided by Nintendo.
Gundam Versus Review;7;Good; Big robots trash big cities and other big robots in the faulty-yet-enjoyable Gundam Versus.;As a keen saver of worlds, James has kicked over his fair share of mechs over the years. He put eight hours into Gundam Versus on PlayStation 4 Pro using a code provided by Bandai Namco.
The Flame in the Flood Review;8;Great; The Flame in the Flood is an harsh and absorbing survival game that never lets you rest on your laurels, with fantastic audiovisual design direction.;Edmond Tran spent over 15 hours rollin‰Ûª on the river, and roughly the same amount of time listening to the Flame in the Flood soundtrack together with ambient water sounds. The Molasses Flood provided GameSpot with a PC copy of the game for this review.

An advance copy of the game was provided by Warner Bros. for review.
The Evil Within 2 Review;8;Great; The sequel to the mind-bending survival-horror game is a clever follow up that makes some big changes.;Alessandro enjoys survival horror games and thinks the Resident Evil remake is one of the best games ever made.

Cuphead Review;8;Great; Cuphead is an artistic tour de force and a brutal side-scrolling action game that pushes you to become a better player.;In the span of 24 hours, Peter got to the end of Cuphead's last world but fell two bosses short of the finale. He played through the majority of the game on Xbox One, but spent two hours with the PC version at the start. Microsoft provided a complimentary copy of the game for the purpose of this review.
Star Fox 2 Review;5;Mediocre; Star Fox 2 could have been an impressive game in the '90s but it fails to make a favorable impression today.;Michael wasn‰Ûªt very good at the original Star Fox when he played it over and over as a kid, but found his pilot wings with countless hours in Star Fox 64 a few years after. Returning to Star Fox 2 brought back those space-faring memories as he spent around 5 hours with Star Fox 2 and finished the game three times for this review. Nintendo provided GameSpot with the SNES Classic on which the game was played.
South Park: The Fractured But Whole Review;8;Great; Ubisoft's follow-up to the Stick of Truth shines with a rewarding combat system wrapped around South Park's distinct brand of humor.;It took Miguel 22 hours to save South Park, thanks to the help of Coon and Friends.

FIFA 18 Nintendo Switch Review;5;Mediocre; FIFA 18 is replicated well on the pitch, but there's not enough to do once the whistle blows for full time.;Oscar spent around 10 hours playing FIFA 18 on Nintendo Switch, and double that trying to think of a Switch / life's a pitch pun. He was not successful. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game for the purposes of this review.
Echo Review;8;Great; Echo is a marvel of A.I. programming bolstered by a compelling sci-fi storytelling, and injects new life into the stealth genre.;Justin Clark spent seven hours getting through Echo. Luckily for him, the only thing he's taught his Echo is how to make pancakes and beat Battletoads. A digital copy of this game was provided by the publisher.
NBA Live 18 Review;7;Good; EA Sports' basketball series returns from a one-year hiatus with new features that outshine its traditional modes.;Miguel needed about 15 hours to make a name for himself in The One and spent and additional 10 hours evaluating NBA Live 18's other modes.

GameSpot was provided with a complimentary PS4 copy of FIFA 18 for the purposes of this review.
Project Cars 2 Review;7;Good; Project Cars 2 builds on its predecessor with improved handling and impressive scope, but it still suffers from unruly AI and a slew of bugs.;Richard spent over 15 hours on the hot asphalt of Project Cars 2's various motorsports. Stick him on an icy track and his Bambi impression is second to none. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary PS4 copy of the game for the purpose of this review.

With plenty of gallows humor and a 16-bit Don Bluth aesthetic, it breathes ...;Dan Starkey‰Ûªs been playing RTS games for more than 20 years, and he‰Ûªs always excited to see one try new and creative ideas.

Ruiner Review;8;Great; Ruiner's world of pure and absolute murder is one teeming with interesting concepts, and its stellar combat makes it a journey well worth taking.;David Rayfield would prefer to convey his emotions via a face helmet covered in pretty lights. But until someone hacks his brain, a non-committal shrug will have to do. He spent around 10 hours completing the story, replaying missions, and soaking up the atmosphere. Ruiner was reviewed on PC.
SteamWorld Dig 2 Review;9;Superb; SteamWorld Dig 2 is a brilliant evolution of the first that not only expands upon its hybrid formula, but presents it in its best light.;Matt spent about 10 hours playing SteamWorld Dig 2. He was a light fan of the previous SteamWorld games and found this latest entry to be a pleasant surprise. He hopes to keep playing to unearth all the secrets the game has to offer, while making a multitude of digging puns about his exploits to his friends along the way. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy for the purposes of this review.
NBA 2K18 Review;8;Great; NBA 2K18 is the gold standard for sports simulations, but this year's entry is overloaded with microtransactions.;Seth reviewed NBA 2K18 using copies of the game provided by Take-Two Interactive, which included 200,000 VC. He put it in 20 hours on the Xbox One version and roughly 5 hours on the Switch, with additional testing of the PlayStation 4 version handled by GameSpot stuff

Marvel Vs. Capcom: Infinite Review;8;Great; Marvel Vs. Capcom: Infinite is a deep and rewarding fighting game for both hardcore and casual players alike, but has a few rough edges.;Tamoor is currently running a team of Dante and Gamora with the Power Stone. He's desperately trying to unlearn years of three button-based muscle memory. The nerves on his fingertips are all dead. RIP. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary PS4 copy of the game for the purpose of this review.
Knack 2 Review;7;Good; Knack returns in a surprisingly fun sequel that makes great use of its shape-shifting hero.;Jason D‰ÛªAprile spent about 10 hours bashing things into submission in Knack 2 with a nine-year old in tow to argue about who has to pull switches and who gets to run through the doors.

Everybody's Golf Review;8;Great; Sony's long-running golf series hits a birdie in its feature-rich PlayStation 4 debut.;It look Miguel about 25 hours of tour competition to reach Everybody's Golf's end credits, and he spent an additional five hours checking out its online modes.

He's looking forward to modding them in to PES 2018 so he no longer has to play as South West Red. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game for the purpose of this review.
Dishonored: Death Of The Outsider Review;8;Great; This stand-alone follow-up is a well-designed and inventive stealth-action game that closes out the story set by its predecessors.;Alessandro is an admirer of the Dishonored series, and usually chooses the stealthy and most non-lethal approach--but will make exceptions if a particular target deserves a far more brutal fate. If getting a target's comeuppance means throwing them off a balcony or feeding them to the rats, then he will gladly make it happen. GameSpot was provided a complimentary copy of the game by Bethesda for the purposes of this review.
Yakuza Kiwami Review;8;Great; Yakuza Kiwami picks up where Yakuza Zero left off, upholding its dramatic storytelling, offbeat humor, and flashy yet frustrating combat.;Peter finished Yakuza Kiwami in 30 hours on PlayStation 4 using a complimentary copy of the game provided by Sega.
The Pillars Of The Earth Review;7;Good; The Pillars of the Earth tells a gripping story of personal and political drama, but its slow pace may not make it a good fit for everyone.;A fan of adventure games, Blake Hester took his time with The Pillars of the Earth, talking to as many NPCs as possible and collecting as many story scraps as he could. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game for the purposes of this review.
Yonder: The Cloud Catcher Chronicles Review;6;Fair; A meditative game about exploring and gathering that offers great beauty but not much else.;James O'Connor completed Yonder's main quest and explored the full map, building farms and completing sidequests long after the credits rolled. He loved Breath of the Wild so much that he might have brought it up even if Yonder had nothing to do with it. A review code was provided by the publisher.
Guardians Of The Galaxy - Episode 3: More Than A Feeling Review;6;Fair; Episode 3 of Telltale's Guardians of the Galaxy series has well-developed relationships and conflict but suffers from similar problems as its predecessors.;Kallie just wants Gamora and Nebula to get along. Telltale provided GameSpot with a complimentary code for the purposes of this review.
Distrust Review;7;Good; Distrust is a roguelike isometric survival game inspired by The Thing where hunger and sleepiness are as frightening as the aliens hunting you.;Leif Johnson writes about video games on a remote ranch near the Texas coast. For the purposes of this review, he played Distrust for around ten hours using a copy of the game provided by the publisher.
F1 2017 Review;9;Superb; Codemasters sweeps the podium with the best Formula One game ever made.;When James was 5 he asked his Dad for a mini-Formula One car for Christmas...it never came.

Mario + Rabbids: Kingdom Battle Review;9;Superb; The unlikely collision of Mario and Rabbid franchises is delightfully charming, and features a deeply satisfying turn-based tactics system.;Edmond Tran loves turn-based strategy, and has been into tactical games ever since he played Front Mission 3. He's also one of those people that owns too many Amiibo. GameSpot was provided a complimentary copy for the purposes of review.

He tried the game on both PS4 and PS4 Pro with a code provided by the publisher.
Absolver Review;8;Great; Absolver's methodical combat would be superlative on its own, but the unique customisation of its Combat Deck takes this melee brawler to thrilling new heights.;Richard spent over 15 hours with Absolver, and is currently trying to rank up enough to open his own fighting school. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game for the purpose of this review.
Life Is Strange: Before The Storm - Episode 1 - Awake Review;8;Great; Deck Nine's Life Is Strange prequel ditches time travel, but finds power of a different sort.;Justin Clark completed Before the Storm Episode 1 in about two hours, and played a second time through to experience the game's alternate choices. Surprisingly, he didn't miss Ashly Burch. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game.
Madden NFL 18 Review;9;Superb; An intensely personal story mode, graphical upgrades, and frequent updates make Madden NFL 18 one of the series' best games in recent memory.;Alex Newhouse played 25 hours of Madden NFL 18, five of which were spent completing Longshot. As a Patriots fan, he spent a lot of time delightfully playing with the team's too-good receiver corps. He played on a PS4 Pro with a code provided by EA.
Don't Knock Twice Review;5;Mediocre; One playthrough is quite enough for the brief and uninspired Don't Knock Twice.;Justin Clark spent two hours on Don't Knock Twice, playing through in both 2D and VR.
Thumper Review;9;Superb; Thumper's unrelenting speed and menacing percussion are overwhelming, seeping into your subconscious in the best way possible.;Peter made it to the final stage of Thumper over the course of eight hours before writing this review. It made his heart race, his complexion fade, and his eyes widen. He loved every minute of it. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game for the purpose of this review.
XCOM 2: War Of The Chosen Review;9;Superb; Building upon the sturdy foundation laid out by XCOM 2, War of the Chosen sets a high mark for an already exceptional sci-fi strategy series.;Dan Starkey's a big fan of defending Earth from extraterrestrials, and, more importantly, putting his tactical and strategic prowess to the test. He received an early preview copy and later a full retail build for the purposes of this review.
Warriors All-Stars Review;7;Good; It's Dynasty Warriors as you've seen it before, except you can be a talking cat with a gun.;Sean spent far too much time doing side-missions and saw two of the game's 15 endings. A copy of the game was supplied for this review.
Nidhogg 2 Review;7;Good; Nidhogg 2 is more bloated and less refined than its predecessor, but it remains an engrossing and hilarious multiplayer game.;Neither of Oscar's ears were harmed (too much) in the making of this article. A complimentary code was provided to GameSpot for the purposes of this review.
Lawbreakers PC Review;8;Great; Boss Key's impressive debut offers a host of inviting anti-gravity battlegrounds.;In the process of logging 20 hours of combat time (30 if you include the betas), Miguel tried out every class in every available map and mode combination.

Uncharted: The Lost Legacy Review;9;Superb; A dynamic duo from Uncharted's rich cast of colorful characters proves there's life after Nathan Drake.;As is his tradition with every Uncharted, Miguel's first playthrough of The Lost Legacy was on Hard difficulty, where he needed six hours to take Chloe and Nadine to the game's conclusion.

Lawbreakers PS4 Review;7;Good; Boss Key's impressive debut offers a host of inviting anti-gravity battlegrounds.;In the process of logging 20 hours of combat time (30 if you include the betas), Miguel tried out every class in every available map and mode combination.

The Long Dark Review;6;Fair; Bugs and a rough story weaken what is, at its core, a great survival game.;James Swinbanks has survived the dangerous wildlife in Australia for over 30 years and spent a combined 33 hours in The Long Dark's story and sandbox modes playing a copy he purchased on PC. Note: A scripting bug meant that a crucial element of the end game didn't trigger until after a number of patches had been put out. A patch worked and fixed the problem, but it also tacked on an extra few hours to the end.
Agents Of Mayhem Review;4;Poor; Obnoxious attitude, poor mission design, and technical bugs make Agents of Mayhem chaotic and repetitive.;Brett played 35 hours of the PS4 version of Agents of Mayem for the purpose of this review, using a complimentary copy of the game provided by the publisher.
Matterfall Review;6;Fair; PS4's Matterfall is a visually stunning yet uninspiring hybrid of Housemarque's past successes.;Jeremy Winslow played through Matterfall three different times on multiple difficulties to test adaptability and challenge. And each time he hit the boss stages, he died--a lot. Death didn't stop him from trying to get the highest score possible, though.

Splatoon 2 Review;8;Great; Splatoon 2 is a fresh, vibrant sequel that introduces smart updates to the original's unique formula.;Kallie spent just over a week playing Splatoon 2, finding all the collectibles in the single-player campaign and reaching level 13 in multiplayer.

Pyre Review;9;Superb; Pyre's wit and whimsy effortlessly usher you into a captivating world of punishment, sacrifice, and competition.;Peter finished Pyre on PC in 15 hours, and then started a new game on PS4 where he also spent a few hours in multiplayer matches.

Sundered Review;8;Great; Sundered is an enjoyable journey that iterates upon the Metroidvania style in ways that are both satisfying and substantial.;Matt spent about 18 hours playing Sundered. He's currently playing the game a second time to get the best ending, but he hopes to play through an additional time to fully embrace the darkness. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy for the purposes of this review.
Miitopia Review;5;Mediocre; Once the silliness of Miitopia wears off, you're left with a cute and repetitive RPG.;Heidi, thanks to the power of auto-battle and a fast-forward mode, breezed through Miitopia. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game for the purpose of this review.
Hey Pikmin Review;6;Fair; Olimar and his Pikmin are back for another charming adventure, but don't expect it to be as challenging as its console counterparts.;Jason D‰ÛªAprile enjoyed revisiting the adorable Pikmin and spent about 10 hours with them while contemplating the bleak nature of man‰Ûªs extinction--almost certainly at the hands of these absurdly cute little monsters.

Batman - The Enemy Within: The Enigma - Episode 1 Review;8;Great; Telltale starts strong with new characters and a charismatic villain.;Tamoor is vengeance. Tamoor is the night. Tamoor is Batman ... He played on PC.
Tacoma Review;7;Good; Tacoma tells a story that is made compelling by a well-written and -acted cast of characters, but it's just short of being truly satisfying.;Kallie finished Tacoma in five hours and watched all the crew recordings. She also played a round of zero-gravity basketball and spent some time searching for Easter eggs. A complimentary code was provided for the purposes of this review.
Rez Infinite Review;9;Superb; With the addition of VR and its off-rails Area X, Rez Infinite is a new classic for the current generation.;Alexa Ray Corriea completed all of Rez Infinite both in and out of PSVR for the purpose of this review. Code was provided by Sony. It was a wild ride.
Redeemer Review;6;Fair; The will is strong with Redeemer, but the flesh is spongy and bruised.;Justin Clark got through Redeemer's campaign in about seven hours using a complimentary copy of the game provided by Sobaka Studio.
Gigantic Review;8;Great; Traditional MOBA gameplay with an impressive cast of characters and a great setting help Gigantic breathe fresh air into a familiar genre.;Brett shot, slashed, and summoned for around 10 hours while reviewing Gigantic. Motiga provided GameSpot with a complimentary code for the $30 / å£24 ultimate pack add-on.
Mega Man Legacy Collection 2 Review;6;Fair; Capcom collects the Blue Bomber's post-NES career into another handy, albeit somewhat lackluster, Mega Man Legacy Collection.;Justin Clark played through all four titles in the collection with copy of the game provided by Capcom, and has not stopped imitating Elmer Fudd Dr. Light from Mega Man 8 ever since. Please, for the love of God, help him.
The Mage's Tale Review;4;Poor; The Mage's Tale attempts to bring classic PC dungeon crawling into virtual reality, but disappoints at nearly every turn.;Dan Starkey knows his way around some dungeons. Whether it‰Ûªs Legend of Grimrock, Arx Fatalis, or even The Elder Scrolls: Arena, Starkey‰Ûªs dived and delved into the depths of the dankest and darkest dens. He played through The Mage's Tale once with the Oculus touch controllers, which were provided by Oculus along with a complimentary copy of the game.
Cities: Skylines - Mass Transit Review;8;Great; Both virtual mayors and their commuting citizens will enjoy the public-transportation options in the Mass Transit expansion for Cities: Skylines.;When he wasn't performing his duties as a mayor in the real-world, Brett spent about 10 hours schlepping his citizens around town in ever more efficient and innovative ways in the Mass Transit expansion for Cities: Skylines. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the expansion for the purpose of this review.
Rakuen Review;7;Good; Rakuen's unique setting and sweet sensibilities make up for its technical shortcomings.;Janine Hawkins is always eager to hear a good story--even more so if it comes in the form of a game. It took her approximately six and a half hours to complete Rakuen.
Final Fantasy 12: The Zodiac Age Review;9;Superb; One of the best Final Fantasy games gets the remaster treatment it rightfully deserves.;Having put 200 hours in the original Final Fantasy 12, Miguel was confident that playing through the first 30 hours of The Zodiac Age would suffice in evaluating the new features and improvements.

After sweating it out in a raiding guild, she took to Final Fantasy XIV during a hiatus a few years ago and never looked back. This review covers her experience getting to Level 70 and trying everything in the lead-up to the end-game raids, which have yet to be released.
The Walking Dead: A New Frontier - Episode Five: Under the Gallows Review;6;Fair; Some odd dramatic choices and a less-than-satisfying conclusion wrap up the New Frontier season of The Walking Dead.;Brett has played every episode of Telltale's The Walking Dead so far, and it took him 90 minutes to complete the final chapter of A New Frontier. Telltale Games provided him with a complimentary copy of the game for the purpose of this review.
Guardians Of The Galaxy - Episode 2: Under Pressure Review;7;Good; The second episode of Telltale's Guardians of the Galaxy series takes on a slower pace with more focus on characters (and drama).;Kallie really likes dancing baby Groot, but romantic Rocket is pretty cute, too. Telltale provided GameSpot with a complimentary code.
Nex Machina Review;9;Superb; The spirit of Robotron lives again in Housemarque's brilliant and blistering Nex Machina.;Jason D'Aprile spent eight hours alternating between agony and ecstasy among five worlds and three game modes, wondering how 1983 got so far away. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game for the purpose of this review.
Impact Winter Review;6;Fair; Surviving in Impact Winter's brutally cold apocalypse makes for a tense adventure, but it's marred by a number of technical problems that exacerbate an already arduous task.;Edmond loves tense PC survival games. He spent 20 hours with Impact Winter and was only killed by wolves a couple of times. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game for review.
Ever Oasis Review;7;Good; Ever Oasis' story and progression aren't perfectly sound, but the consistent gratification of its incisive design makes it a satisfying adventure.;Matt is still spending time building up his Oasis even after beating the game. He thinks all of the game's characters are adorable, especially the Noots. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy for the purposes of this review.
The Fidelio Incident Review;6;Fair; The Fidelio Incident can be a beautiful and touching game, but it's too often bogged down by shallow objectives.;Justin Clark completed The Fidelio Incident in about 3 hours using a complimentary copy of the game provided by the publisher.
Reservoir Dogs: Bloody Days Review;4;Poor; Reservoir Dogs: Bloody Days attempts to pay homage to its source material, but it fails capture the essence of the cult-classic film that inspired it.;Jeremy Winslow robbed hundreds of banks and shot countless cops to acquire as much money as possible for nearly eight hours in Bloody Days. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary code for the purpose of this review.
Valkyria Revolution Review;6;Fair; While satisfying at times, poor story presentation and an abundance of superfluous elements make Valkyria Revolution less than the sum of its parts.;Heidi put approximately 30 hours into Valkyria Revolution. She's still holding out for an official English language release of Valkyria Chronicles 3...someday. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game for the purpose of this review.
Star Trek: Bridge Crew Review;6;Fair; Star Trek: Bridge Crew is a daring concept that goes where many games have gone before.;Justin Clark completed Star Trek: Bridge Crew's single-player campaign on PSVR in four hours, spending another three online before writing his review. By his count, seven of his suggestions when playing a role other than captain were shouted down by someone yelling ‰ÛÏShut up, Wesley!‰Û GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game for the purpose of this review.
Wipeout Omega Collection Review;9;Superb; This remastered trio splendidly captures Studio Liverpool's turn-of-the-decade hover racing renaissance.;Miguel spent about eight hours exploring all the modes in all the games of this collection. Two of those hours were also spent online. A code was provided by Sony Interactive Entertainment for the purposes of this review.
Arms Review;7;Good; Arms' unique take on fighting can be hard to adjust to, but once you do, it's a surprisingly deep fighter that has you thinking on your feet.;Kallie played through Arms' Grand Prix mode with several characters
Steel Division: Normandy '44 Review;8;Great; Steel Division is an aggressive, focused tactical game that deftly leverages historical realism to create unique twists on the RTS formula.;Dan Starkey is a strategy-game obsessive. He‰Ûªs also just about tapped out on World War II‰ÛÒfocused games, Steel Division: Normandy '44 proves him wrong. He received an early copy, and a final review copy for the purposes of this review.
Dirt 4 Review;9;Superb; Dirt 4 is a grounded and thrilling racing experience with customisable difficulty options that should appeal to newcomers and veterans alike.;Richard spent around 30 hours on the precarious tracks of Dirt 4, gradually improving enough to not hit every tree.
Get Even Review;7;Good; The Farm 51's psychological thriller tells a story you won't forget.;Eddie Makuch finished Get Even's campaign on PS4 in around 10 hours and he's still thinking about the dramatic ending. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game for the purpose of this review.
Tekken 7 Review;8;Great; Despite some faults outside of the ring, Tekken 7's diverse cast and time-honored fighting system make it one of the best 3D fighting games around.;Peter has been a home-schooled Tekken player since the series debut on the original PlayStation. He completed the main story mode of Tekken 7 and every individual character story on PS4, and spent a few hours fighting treasure and online battles on all platforms before writing his review. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game for all platforms.
Friday The 13th: The Game Review;4;Poor; A week after launch, Friday the 13th remains the buggy and sometimes-broken game it was on the day of its release.;Peter spent ten hours with the PC version of Friday the 13th but had far less success playing the game on consoles, with server issues abound that limited the availability of matches. GameSpot was provided multiple complimentary copies of the game for each platform.
Perception Review;5;Mediocre; A novel and inventive approach to first-person exploration falls short of its ambitions.;Miguel needed about three hours to complete his exploration of all the incarnations of the house where Perception takes place. A complementary PC code was provided for this review.
Call Of Duty: Black Ops 3 Zombies Chronicles Review;8;Great; Black Ops 3's Zombies Chronicles upgrades some of the best Zombies maps for new and returning players alike.;Kallie has played a lot of Zombies over the years with her younger brother and has really good Mystery Box luck. A complimentary code was provided by Activision.
Danger Zone Review;6;Fair; Though rough around the edges, Danger Zone does a commendable job recapturing some of Burnout's lightning in a bottle.;Justin Clark got through all of Danger Zone's available courses in about 4 hours, give or take the time spent listening to Kenny Loggins on a loop. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game for this review.
Tokyo 42 Review;7;Good; This beautiful cyberpunk playground holds a staggering amount of detail but not enough reasons to stay.;David Rayfield wishes to live in a real cyberpunk dystopia one day--the kind with retinal implants and dangerous contacts. For now, video games will have to fill that void. Tokyo 42 was played on both Xbox One and PC.
Endless Space 2 Review;8;Great; Endless Space 2 provides loads of 4X strategizing and space-opera-styled storytelling in this epic about building an intergalactic empire.;Brett spent around 30 hours of exploring, expanding, exploiting, and exterminating in Endless Space 2 to write this review. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game by its publisher.
Rime Review;6;Fair; Shallow puzzles and frustrating navigation mar an otherwise beautiful experience.;Oscar spent around 14 hours playing Rime, and he now wants a magical disappearing fox for a pet. A complimentary PS4 code was provided to GameSpot for this review.
The Town Of Light Review;4;Poor; The Town of Light examines mental illnesses and the hospitals meant to treat them in the early 1900s, but ultimately fails to stick the landing.;A fan of exploration-driven adventure games, Blake Hester completed The Town of Light on Xbox One and collected as many of the story bits as he could along the way. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game for the purpose of this review.
Prey Review;6;Fair; Prey squanders its narrative opportunities but develops into an engaging open-world shooter.;Tamoor played Prey for 40 hours. At least 10 of those were spent rolling around Talos I as a coffee cup.
NBA Playgrounds Review;6;Fair; NBA Playgrounds matches NBA Jam's irreverent take on basketball, but it doesn't do enough to stand out on its own.;Blake Hester is a longtime NBA Jam fan that was excited to see if Playgrounds could recapture a similar arcade feel. For his review, he played over 30 matches online and off, scored over 600 points, and unlocked 62 players from the game's roster. He also played the game on mute. GameSpot was provided with complimentary copies of the game for review.
Mages of Mystralia Review;6;Fair; Mages of Mystralia has charm and a lot of heart, but it falls a bit short of delivering a memorable adventure.;Alessandro is an admirer of classic adventure games like The Legend of Zelda, and he was excited to try out this title that made its start on Kickstarter. After about six hours, he cleared through Mages Of Mystralia's adventure and found a lot to like over the course of the journey. He received a complimentary copy of the game from the publisher for review.
Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia Review;9;Superb; Fire Emblem Echoes' combat and exploration work so well that you won't lament the absence of the series' recent dating-sim whims.;Heidi first got into the FE series with the original English release on Game Boy Advance and has followed the franchise since. She completed Echoes in 32 hours, using a complimentary copy of the game provided by Nintendo.
Strafe Review;8;Great; Strafe doesn't do too much, but its exceptional execution and unique charm make for a truly intense, old-school FPS experience.;Michael was strafing, jumping, and swiping his mouse around to land perfect shots as a kid in games like Unreal Tournament and Quake III. That hard work paid off, evident in the 12 hours he spent to complete Strafe after more attempts than he's willing to admit and getting through seven rooms in Murderzone mode. A complimentary copy was provided by Devolver Digital.
The Surge Review;7;Good; The Surge is an entertaining twist on the Dark Souls formula that strikes a tenuous balance between iteration and invention.;Starkey's played every major Souls game, as well their many spin-offs and inspirations. After spending some time with Lords of the Fallen, he didn‰Ûªt have high hopes for Surge, but he was pleasantly surprised. He received a complimentary review copy from the publisher.
Farpoint Review;7;Good; Justin Clark completed Farpoint's campaign in about five and a half hours and spent another two fooling around in Challenge mode--and didn't even have to take a Dramamine this time.;Bolstered by the Aim Controller, Impact Gear delivers a strong shooter experience on PlayStation VR but surprises and awes when it strives for more.
Pinstripe Review;5;Mediocre; Pinstripe's spooky atmosphere will catch your eye, but its straightforward puzzles and clunky combat may cause you to look the other way.;Jeremy Winslow thought it would be a great idea to visit the devil, so he booked a one-way trip to Hell. Though he zoned out during Pinstripe's battles and puzzles, he'd be lying if he said the dialogue didn't make him chuckle now and then. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game for review.
Super Rude Bear Resurrection Review;9;Superb; Super Rude Bear is a tough-as-nails platformer that gives meaning to your every death and provides a nonstop stream of new challenges from beginning to end.;Chris Pereira spent more than a dozen hours dying across the PS4 and PC versions of Super Rude Bear Resurrection. He even finished quite a few levels without leaving behind a corpse. GameSpot was provided with complimentary copies of the game.
Tumbleseed Review;6;Fair; Tumbleseed is a challenging roguelike about literally and figuratively balancing, but some of its many moving parts are off-kilter.;Kallie very slowly made her way up Tumbleseed's mountain of death and only ragequit a few times. A complimentary code was provided to GameSpot.
Expeditions: Viking Review;6;Fair; Expeditions: Viking is a rough-hewn game with an abundance of charm. Deep role playing and nuanced, tactical combat save this technical mess.;As a resident of the Twin Cities, Dan Starkey's got a smidge of the Viking spirit. As a roleplayer, he's dipped into everything from White Wolf and loves having a bevy of tactical options available to think through any encounter. GameSpot received a complimentary copy of the game.
Syberia 3 Review;4;Poor; For a game that relies on character interaction and puzzles to tell its story, Syberia 3 falls well short of being enjoyable and fails to deliver a captivating or impactful ...;Michael was captivated by point-and-click adventure games early in life with the likes of Broken Sword: Shadow of the Templars and Escape From Monkey Island. Having played Syberia 1 and 2 all those years ago, he looked forward to what the third game had to offer and spent about 12 hours to complete Kate Walker's new journey. A copy of Syberia 3 was provided by Microids.
Birthdays The Beginning Review;5;Mediocre; The ambitious-but-flawed Birthdays the Beginning is packed with charm, but suffers from a clunky interface and confusing systems.;Heidi, despite several episodes of frustration, managed to complete the game's story mode and a few of the optional challenges for this review.
Outlast 2 Review;7;Good; Outlast 2's scripted chases can grow frustrating, but its gripping atmosphere and unnerving sound design deliver unparalleled tension.;It took Scott nearly a dozen hours to trek though Outlast 2's desert hellscape, though he immediately started over at a higher difficulty once he finished his first run. He also reviewed Resident Evil 7 back in January, if you'd like a reference point for his taste in horror. GameSpot received complimentary download codes for the purposes of this review.
Puyo Puyo Tetris Review;8;Great; Two classic puzzle games meet head-on to form Puyo Puyo Tetris, a great mashup with multiple ways to play.;Jason D'Aprile spent 10 hours within the zany world of Puyos and Tetrominoes, and about a million playing Tetris over the last few decades. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary download code for the purpose of this review.
The Disney Afternoon Collection Review;7;Good; Six retro games to remind you that games from the good old days were difficult, but relentlessly charming.;Jason D'Aprile spent around seven hours blissfully dying in a fit of nostalgic wonder while playing The Disney Afternoon Collection. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game for the purpose of this review.
Dragon Quest Heroes II Review;8;Great; A second re-imagining of Dragon Quest as a hack-and-slasher proves to be as fresh and involving as the first crossover.;Miguel needed 25 hours to complete Dragon Quest Heroes II's campaign, using a pre-release version of the game. He played an additional five hours of the retail version to evaluate online multiplayer. Both versions were provided courtesy of Square Enix. Miguel came into this playthrough having reviewed the last Dragon Quest Heroes, while also having completed a handful of Dynasty Warriors and Dragon Quest games.
Injustice 2 Review;9;Superb; NetherRealm sets a new bar for fighting games in 2017 with Injustice 2, despite over-complicating its most distinct feature.;Peter has played most Mortal Kombat and DC fighting games from Ed Boon and company since the '90s, and very much enjoyed NetherRealm's last game, Mortal Kombat X. He spent 15 hours with Injustice 2 on PlayStation 4, and a few hours with the Xbox One version, beating the story mode twice and raising Superman to level 20 after countless fights in the Multiverse. GameSpot was provided with complimentary copies of the game by Warner Bros. Interactive.
What Remains of Edith Finch Review;9;Superb; Giant Sparrow's follow-up to The Unfinished Swan is a beautifully melancholy collection of parables.;Justin Clark was able to play through What Remains of Edith Finch within two and a half hours, viewing all 11 stories and replaying two of them. A review code was provided by the publisher.
Sniper Ghost Warrior 3 Review;5;Mediocre; A newfound focus on player choice pushes CI Games' series in a positive direction, but myriad issues keep it from being a top marksman.;Richard spent roughly 15 hours in the muddy boots of protagonist Jon North. At least 45 minutes of that was probably spent in loading screens.
The Walking Dead: A New Frontier - Episode Four: Thicker Than Water Review;7;Good; Storylines finally converge satisfyingly in Thicker Than Water, the penultimate chapter of the New Frontier.;Two more hours with Javy, David, Kate, and the rest of the dysfunctional gang helped Brett review Thicker Than Water. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game for the purpose of this review.
Hacknet - Labyrinths Review;8;Great; With its challenging puzzles and dark, intriguing narrative, Hacknet will upload itself to your must play list;Despite being hopelessly inept at remembering his own passwords, James managed to complete both the Hacknet and Labyrinths campaigns in around 20 hours. Review code was provided by the publisher.
Drawn To Death Review;4;Poor; Drawn to Death has a big imagination, but it does not play well with others.;Justin spent 8 hours with Drawn to Death, playing at least an hour with the game‰Ûªs entire roster (not counting time spent waiting for matches).
Little Nightmares Review;8;Great; Little Nightmares' brief length may leave you craving more, but its haunting story and visuals make it a journey well worth taking.;Matt spent about 2 hours playing Little Nightmares during his first playthrough. He completed the game twice on PC for this review with a copy provided by the Bandai Namco.
Momodora: Reverie Under The Moonlight Review;6;Fair; Momodora Reverie Under the Moonlight is a retro adventure with charm, but it runs out of steam a bit too soon.;"Peter enjoys ""Metroidvanias,"" especially Super Metroid and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. He played through Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight once, completing it in five and half hours. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game for the purpose of this review."
Bulletstorm: Full Clip Edition Review;8;Great; Only six years have passed since the wildly inventive Bulletstorm originally released, which may be why this update looks so good and plays so smoothly.;Scott reviewed Bulletstorm for another outlet back in 2011. He loved it then, so unsurprisingly, he loves it now as well, in spite of its self-consciously douchey characters. GameSpot was provided with complimentary download codes for the purposes of this review.
Cosmic Star Heroine Review;6;Fair; This take on classic turn-based RPGs struggles to give its fresh ideas room to breathe.;Janine Hawkins has never said no to a good, old-fashioned space adventure, though she's spent a few too many hours with middling early-'90s anime role-playing games to be swayed by nostalgia alone. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game for the purpose of this review.
The Sexy Brutale Review;8;Great; The Sexy Brutale is a beautiful puzzler that skillfully combines time loops and elements of Clue.;Leif Johnson writes about video games on a remote ranch near the Texas coast. For this purposes of this review, he played The Sexy Brutale for around nine hours. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary download code for the purpose of this review.
Toukiden 2 Review;7;Good; A new kind of Devil Crush.;Heidi didn't play the first Toukiden, but she came away quite satisfied with its sequel. She played through Chapter 6, finished a few quests in Chapter 7, and spent a good deal of time joining and hosting multiplayer games. Maybe you ran into her if you saw a hyper-aggressive gauntlet user. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game for the purposes of this review.
Mr. Shifty Review;8;Great; A scrappy underdog of a game that will send you on a short but glorious power trip.;James finished Mr. Shifty on Switch in about 4 hours (needing to stop for breaks--because, wow, is this game intense) and tested out the first three levels of the PC version. He now longs for Switch ports of Hotline Miami 1 and 2. GameSpot was provided with complimentary download codes for the purposes of this review.
Guardians Of The Galaxy - Episode 1: Tangled Up In Blue Review;7;Good; The first episode of Telltale's Guardians of the Galaxy series has an engaging movie-style pace that's interrupted by its game-like elements.;Kallie played through Episode 1 twice and had a really hard time disappointing Gamora. Telltale provided GameSpot with a complimentary code.
Has-Been Heroes Review;5;Mediocre; This roguelike‰Ûªs cool combat system is held back by a terrible structure.;James O‰ÛªConnor spent 10 hours with Has-Been Heroes on Nintendo Switch before standing back and noting that the brick wall he‰Ûªd been hurling himself at was barely dented. A review code was supplied by the publisher.
Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Review;9;Superb; Mario Kart 8 Deluxe makes significant updates to the original that make its racing chaos the definitive version.;Kallie finished every cup on 150cc with three stars and plans to do the same on 200cc (again). A complimentary code was provided to GameSpot for the purposes of this review.
Warhammer 40000: Dawn Of War III Review;8;Great; Dawn of War III mashes micromanagement and big-scale strategy together in a system that‰Ûªs messy but exhilarating.;Dan Starkey's been a Warhammer fan since college. While he prefers the fantasy universe to 40K, he‰Ûªs no stranger to the far-flung future. He's a huge fan of the original Dawn of War and the more recent Battlefleet Gothic: Armada. He was provided a complimentary copy of the game for the purposes of this review.
Wonder Boy: The Dragon's Trap Review;8;Great; Short but sweet, this superb remake reintroduces an overlooked classic in style.;Heidi, despite being a huge Sega dork, didn't own a Master System back when Wonder Boy first hit the scene. (Shhh!) She completed a full playthrough of the new Wonder Boy: The Dragon's Trap and found several of the optional secret areas. GameSpot was provided with complimentary download codes for the purpose of this review.
Rain World Review;5;Mediocre; An endearingly designed creature and a captivating world in ruins cannot save this 2D platformer from its punishing gameplay.;Miguel needed about 20 hours to complete Rain World. A complementary PS4 code was provided by Adult Swim Games for review purposes.
Snake Pass Review;7;Good; Snake Pass is a unique and beautiful platformer, but one that is marred by a steep difficulty curve.;Oscar took around eight hours to finish Snake Pass, and while his love for serpents is stronger than ever, he now hates hummingbirds. A complimentary Xbox One copy of the game was provided by Sumo Digital for the purpose of this review.
Yooka-Laylee Review;6;Fair; Yooka-Laylee delivers on nostalgia but is held back by outdated gameplay and underwhelming levels.;Kallie finished Yooka-Laylee in 20 hours and found around 75% of the collectibles using a complimentary code provided to GameSpot. She replays Banjo-Kazooie at least once a year.
Everything Review;6;Fair; Everything is a grand experiment that manages to inspire and disappoint in equal measure.;Justin Clark spent five hours with Everything before reaching what could be construed as an ending. Though really there are no endings. There is only a series of quantum transitions from state to state, with infinite possibilities of form, all distinct and yet all the same and familiar, a vessel that may change shape but carries the same content. A complimentary code for the game was provided by the developer.
Stories Untold Review;7;Good; Short horror anthology Stories Untold preys on technological nostalgia, which works three times out of four.;James O‰ÛªConnor is a fan of horror fiction, although he‰Ûªs just slightly too young to have used the retro machines featured in the game. He spent five hours playing through Stories Untold. The author was provided with code for this review.
Persona 5 Review;9;Superb; Persona 5's compulsive gameplay and infectious energy make it a standout RPG.;Lucy spent over 80 hours with Persona 5, romancing the best waifu (Ann) and unlocking the true ending. A complimentary PS4 copy of the game was provided by Atlus.
The Walking Dead: The Telltale Series - A New Frontier Ep. 3: Above The Law Review;6;Fair; A satisfying story can't make up for the lack of action and interactivity in Above the Law.;Brett spent about two hours with Javi and Clementine to write this review of the PC version of Above the Law.
Dark Souls 3: The Ringed City Review;8;Great; The Ringed City is a well-executed conclusion to the revered Dark Souls series.;Dan is a dyed-in-the-wool Souls fan and proud member of the Sunlight Covenant. They brought over a level-148 New Game+ character from Dark Souls III, playing through each over the weekend. Temporary early-access codes were provided by Bandai Namco for the sake of review, though Dan bought the expansion outright once the time was up.
Snipperclips Review;7;Good; Snipperclips is an engaging puzzler that's fun to play in groups, even if there's no long-lasting appeal.;Randolph made his seven-year-old son stop playing Breath of the Wild on the Switch for a few hours to play coop with him while reviewing Snipperclips. His wife also played (under duress, as she's not much of a gamer). But everybody loved it! Nintendo provided GameSpot with a copy of the game.
Fast RMX Review;7;Good; Fast RMX injects Switch's launch lineup with lightning-fast futuristic racing.;Jason D‰ÛªAprile spent seven hours speeding across the tracks of the future in Fast RMX, both online and off. Nintendo provided a complimentary download code of Fast RMX for the purpose of this review.
Flatout 4: Total Insanity Review;5;Mediocre; Flatout 4 brings the franchise into the modern day and gets away from the line with a dash, but nonsensical progression and frustrating AI quickly kills its drive.;A veteran of racing and driving games, James put nearly 15 hours into all game modes including the career, Flatout mode and quickplay and multiplayer, and even convinced his fiance to try out the party mode in split screen. The PS4 review code was provided by the publisher.
MLB The Show 17 Review;8;Great; Sony's long-running baseball sim returns, with better action on the field, and more options off it.;Richard divided his time between every mode in MLB The Show 17 over roughly 40 hours of playtime. He will still continue to watch replays of particularly sumptuous hits.
Torment: Tides of Numenera Review;9;Superb; Torment: Tides of Numenera is a fascinating old-school RPG that doubles down on the concept of role-playing.;Dan Starkey loves two genres above all others: strategy games and RPGs. He‰Ûªs been an avid fan of everything from pen-and-paper classics all the way up to Fallout 4, but modern RPGs have left him wanting--that is, until Torment. He spent 40 hours over a week and a half diving into Earth‰Ûªs far-flung future with review code provided by the publisher.
Thimbleweed Park Review;7;Good; Thimbleweed Park is a point-and-click adventure full of enticing secrets to uncover, but its adherence to the genre's unremedied issues sometimes brings it down.;"Matt spent 21 hours playing Thimbleweed Park. After beating the game, he has decided that he wants to attach the phrase ""a-reno"" to the end of random words in his sentences. He hopes to get away with adding it into his copy for the rest of his career at GameSpot. Oh, and he's a huge fan of point-and-click adventure games. A complimentary copy of the game was provided by Terrible Toybox for the purpose of this review."
Ghost Recon: Wildlands Review;7;Good; Ghost Recon is a large scale cooperative shooter rich in content but with questionable lasting appeal.;Miguel needed 40 hours on the PlayStation 4 version to take down El Sueno while also making time for numerous side quests. The PC and Xbox One versions were played for a couple hours as well. Review codes for all platforms were provided by Ubisoft.
Loot Rascals Review;5;Mediocre; Loot Rascals is a gorgeous, tactical turn-based roguelike that doesn‰Ûªt always give back as much as it takes.;James O‰ÛªConnor‰Ûªs favorite roguelike is still Faster Than Light, but he enjoys any excuse to hurl himself at the same wall over and over again. He played Loot Rascals for eight hours on PC for this review. Gamespot was provided with complimentary review code for this game.
Parappa The Rapper Remastered Review;6;Fair; Parappa returns, looking like 2017, but still rapping like 1996.;Justin Clark spent two hours with Parappa the Rapper Remastered, playing up through the final stage, as well as through the game's alternate soundtracks. A complimentary code was provided by Sony for the purposes of this review.
Shovel Knight: Specter Of Torment Review;8;Great; Specter of Torment is a focused and satisfyingly challenging 2D platformer which retains Shovel Knight's strong aesthetic and sense of charm.;Edmond Tran played through the main Shovel Knight campaign multiple times on PC, and spent around 6 total hours with Specter of Torment, exploring all its modes on Nintendo Switch using a Pro Controller.
Styx: Shards Of Darkness Review;6;Fair; Many of the pieces that make up Styx feel dated, but they still come together to make a competent stealth-action experience.;Michael grew up revering stealth-action games like the original Thief and Splinter Cell. He spent about 20 hours with Styx‰Ûªs new adventure on PC, completing every side quest presented, experimenting with different play styles, and experiencing the co-op mode. A complimentary copy was provided by Focus Home Interactive.
Malicious Fallen Review;5;Mediocre; Malicious Fallen delivers some serious flash and flair alongside some serious frustration.;Justin Clark went through each Malicious Fallen boss twice for the purposes of this review. So far, he has yet to find a clothing shop selling cloaks that turn into fists. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary download code for the purposes of this review.
Mass Effect: Andromeda Review;6;Fair; Andromeda's combat soars but its storytelling sputters, making the series' first venture into uncharted space a shaky but occasionally satisfying new adventure.;Scott explored Andromeda for over 60 hours, completing the main campaign and a large chunk of the side content. He founded outposts, tracked down missing ships, and ditched that chump Liam immediately. EA provided GameSpot with complimentary download codes for the purposes of this review.
Horizon Zero Dawn Review;9;Superb; Horizon Zero Dawn is an exciting and breathtaking odyssey.;Peter played Horizon Zero Dawn for 55 hours, finishing the main questline and enough side quests for an 80% completion rating. GameSpot was provided with complimentary copies of the game by Sony.
Ride 2 Review;4;Poor; A confused spectacle that fails to promote the idea of a motorcycle game.;A racing game junkie with an addiction to anything offering the chance to summit a podium, John raced for 15 hours around Ride 2‰Ûªs tarmac on PC.
Berserk And The Band Of The Hawk Review;5;Mediocre; Anime's most well known hack-and-slashing mercenary joins gaming's most prolific hack-and-slash series with mixed results.;Miguel needed 15 hours to complete Berserk's Story Mode without skipping any of the anime and CG cutscenes. An additional hour was spent on the Free Mode and four more hours were needed to evaluate the Endless Eclipse Mode. The main playthrough was conducted on the PS4 version while the PS Vita and PC versions were spot checked at an hour each. Complementary review codes for all three platforms were provided by Koei Tecmo.
Story of Seasons: Trio of Towns Review;7;Good; A handful of interface-related annoyances can‰Ûªt fully drag down the cheerful spirit of this farming-themed social simulation.;Heidi has enjoyed her fair share of these social-simulation titles over the years. She played through several in-game years of Story of Seasons, finding her ideal husband in Ludus after much agonizing deliberation.
For Honor Review;8;Great; For Honor is an incredibly entertaining fighter that's satisfying both in single and multiplayer, even despite the narrative flaws of its story mode.;Matt played around 16 hours of For Honor before writing his review. He predominantly played on PS4, but also played a few hours extra on each the Xbox One and PC versions. His main Heroes are Nobushi, Berserker, and Kensei. Ubisoft provided GameSpot with complimentary copies of the game.
The Legend Of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild Review;10;Essential; The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is Nintendo's most ambitious and impressive game to date.;Peter spent 60 hours in Hyrule before reluctantly finishing the main quest on Switch. He spent an additional two hours testing the Wii U version. He looks forward to seeing everything Breath of the Wild has to offer, assuming he can unearth its secrets. Nintendo provided a complimentary console and a copy of the game for the purpose of this review.
Psychonauts In The Rhombus Of Ruin Review;6;Fair; Our favorite psychic secret agents return, trading platforming for puzzles and flat displays for a VR headset. The results are sweet but far too short.;Even as he tried to savor its immersive environments and silly dialogue, Scott sped through Rhombus of Ruin in just over two hours. At least he never felt motion sick. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game for this review.
1-2-Switch Review;6;Fair; 1-2-Switch gets old very fast, but it's a great ride while the fun lasts.;Oscar annoyed his housemates far too much in testing every 1-2-Switch minigame. No Joy-Cons were harmed in the writing of this review.
Super Bomberman R Review;7;Good; Nintendo Switch gets a blast of nostalgia with the return of Bomberman.;Jason D‰ÛªAprile has been blowing up robots for as long as Bomberman and spent about five or so hours on Super Bomberman R. He was provided with a complimentary copy of the game by Konami.
Warhammer 40000: Sanctus Reach Review;4;Poor; Sanctus Reach pits the hardy Space Marines against the fighty Orks in a massive war that‰Ûªs plagued with issues.;Dan Starkey's been a Warhammer fan since college. While he prefers the fantasy universe to 40K, he still knows his Tyranids from his Necrons. He's a huge fan of Dawn of War and Battlefleet Gothic: Armada. He was provided a complimentary copy of the game for the purposes of review.
Nioh Review;9;Superb; By adapting the Dark Souls formula to the ways of the bushido, we find Team Ninja at the top of their game.;Miguel needed about 85 hours to thoroughly explore all of Nioh's regions while also completing the main story missions and epilogue. Most of his playthrough was experienced solo, though a few of the boss fights were beaten using the game's co-op feature. Sony Interactive Entertainment provided a complimentary review code for PlayStation 4.
Skylanders Imaginators Review;7;Good; Skylanders Imaginators is saved by its focus on character customisation.;Randolph played through the Imaginators campaign and several side missions (and was joined during certain levels by his seven-year-old son, provided he did all his chores). He mainly stuck to playing with the toys you receive in the PlayStation 4 exclusive starter pack, but also experimented with creating other characters. Activision provided a copy of the game, as well as all of the new toys used for this review.
Double Dragon 4 Review;5;Mediocre; The completely retro Double Dragon 4 proves not everything was golden in olden times.;Jason D'Aprile spent about five hours getting knocked around in Double Dragon IV while wondering what happened to his lost youth. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary download code for the PC version of Double Dragon IV.
Linelight Review;7;Good; Linelight is a minimalistic puzzle game that draws you in with its tranquil atmosphere and tests your mettle with ever-increasing challenges.;Peter finished Linelight on PC and spent an hour with the PlayStation 4 version. GameSpot was provided with complementary codes for Linelight for the purpose of this review.
Beholder Review;5;Mediocre; Serving as a landlord under Beholder‰Ûªs totalitarian regime can be tense and exciting, but it can also be quite tedious.;James O‰ÛªConnor appreciates the ‰Û÷perform a mundane job within a horrible regime‰Ûª genre, although nothing has topped Papers, Please yet. He spent seven hours with Beholder, restarting the game once after the first two hours. Review code was supplied by the publisher.
Fire Emblem Heroes Review;6;Fair; Fire Emblem Heroes has compelling draws for both fans and newcomers, but it also doesn‰Ûªt offer many reasons to keep playing in the long run.;Kallie completed Fire Emblem Heroes‰Ûª main quest and spent about $10 on Orbs. Tharja is her best girl.
Divide Review;5;Mediocre; Divide‰Ûªs decent science fiction premise is undermined by tedious and repetitive design.;A longtime sci-fi and RPG fan, Cassidee completed Divide in about 13 hours. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game for the purpose of this review.
Halo Wars 2 Review;6;Fair; Halo Wars 2 is an RTS game for Halo fans with stripped-down strategy elements and limited lasting appeal.;Kallie finished Halo Wars 2‰Ûªs campaign in six hours using a code provided by Microsoft. She has been a Halo fan since Combat Evolved.
Diluvion Review;5;Mediocre; Diluvion tries to bring open-world exploration below sea level--but drowns in the process.;Justin Clark spent 20 hours with Diluvion, six of which were spent growling commands at his crew like Gene Hackman in Crimson Tide. He truly believes that the sense of vague resentment and fear he instilled in his gunner is why his torpedoes never aimed right. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of Diluvion for the purpose of this review.
Poochy and Yoshi‰Ûªs Woolly World Review;7;Good; Poochy and Yoshi‰Ûªs Woolly World‰Ûªs format works well on 3DS, and the best parts of the original Wii U version still stand out.;Kallie completed Poochy and Yoshi‰Ûªs Woolly World in under 10 hours with an early copy provided by Nintendo. She spent many, many hours playing Yoshi‰Ûªs Story as a small child and many more playing other Nintendo platformers.
Sniper Elite 4 Review;8;Great; The grisly ballistics are still second to none, but it's the improvements made beyond the sniper scope that make Sniper Elite 4 a series standout.;Richard completed Sniper Elite 4's campaign in around ten hours, before touching on the authentic difficulty level, and dying a lot in multiplayer. He inflicted quite the checklist of damaged organs, from ruptured brains, hearts, lungs, intestines, and, of course, testicles.
Wild Guns Reloaded Review;8;Great; An enhanced remake of a cult classic, Wild Guns Reloaded offers up a rare breed of white-knuckle arcade-shooting action.;Heidi loves‰ÛÏcrosshair shooter‰Û games--even though she is, admittedly, not that great at them. She gave up on trying to clear Wild Guns Reloaded without using continues before writing her review, much to her great shame. Natsume provided GameSpot with a complimentary copy of the game for review purposes.
Urban Empire Review;6;Fair; Urban Empire is a dense city-building simulation with a twist. It focuses not just on zoning and taxes, but also on building your own political dynasty.;Dan Starkey got his feet wet in the city-building genre with 1999‰Ûªs SimCity 3000. Since then, he's built countless settlements in everything from Banished to Clockwork Empires. For the purposes of this review, he played three games with three different families on each of the major maps, totaling over 40 hours. He was provided a free review copy by the developer.
Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8: Final Chapter Prologue Review;7;Good; Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8: Final Chapter Prologue is a collection of three experiences that range from tantalizing to forgettable.;For the purposes of this review, Leif Johnson played Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8: Final Chapter Prologue for around 20 hours. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy by Square-Enix.
Tales of Berseria Review;7;Good; Thanks to its dark atmosphere and exciting combat, Tales of Berseria is a refreshing change of pace for the long-running RPG series.;Jake completed Tales of Berseria in 50 hours with a complimentary advanced copy provided by Bandai Namco. He‰Ûªs played every Tales game since Tales of Symphonia.
Gravity Rush 2 Review;9;Superb; Gravity Rush 2 is a jam-packed sequel that fulfills its predecessor‰Ûªs untapped potential.;Peter completed Gravity Rush 2 in about 20 hours using a complimentary copy of the game provided by Sony. He previously completed the original Gravity Rush on PlayStation 4.
Yakuza 0 Review;8;Great; Yakuza Zero's humorous world is packed goofy quests and minigames, but the story cuts through it with powerful characters and high-stakes drama.;Peter has dabbled in previous Yakuza games, but Yakuza Zero is the first game in the series he's completed. He beat Yakuza Zero in 38 hours, which included about 10 hours of exploring optional missions and minigames. Sega provided GameSpot with a complimentary copy of the game for review.
Steep Review;7;Good; Steep is an enjoyable open-world game that excels in exploration but suffers from finicky controls and repetitive challenges.;Leif Johnson writes about video games on a remote ranch near the Texas coast. For the purposes of this review, he completed Steep in 12 hours on Xbox One using a complimentary copy of the game provided by Ubisoft.
Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun Review;8;Great; Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun is a real-time tactical stealth game with gorgeous levels and clever mechanics.;Dan Starkey's played stealth games for as long as he can remember, starting with Thief before branching out into all manner of sneaky adventures. He played through Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun in 24 hours using a complimentary copy of the game provided by Daedalic Entertainment.
Dragon Ball Fusions Review;6;Fair; Fan service abounds in Dragon Ball Fusions--and, unfortunately, so does repetition.;Heidi spent around 30 hours in the world of Dragon Ball Fusions, collecting an army of the strongest Saiyans, Namekians, and other odd combinations of characters to fill out her team of ultimate warriors. She was really hoping Launch, the most underrated Dragon Ball female character, might show up in this game for some fun fusion time--but at least we got Arale! GameSpot was provided with a complimentary game for the purpose of this review.
The Walking Dead: The Telltale Series - A New Frontier Ep. 1: Ties That Bind Part One Review;9;Superb; The third season of Telltale‰Ûªs take on The Walking Dead takes the franchise in a new direction, and brings back a familiar face.;Brett hung out in (the virtual version of) Prescott for about four hours while playing through The Ties That Bind Part I twice. He was provided with a complimentary pre-release copy of the game by Telltale Games.
Resident Evil 7: Biohazard Review;8;Great; Despite dragging in spots, Resident Evil 7's house of horrors recaptures the tension that first made the series a household name.;Scott survived RE7's full campaign in roughly 12 hours before enduring a further few hours in VR. He only screamed out loud twice. Publisher Capcom provided a copy of the game for this review.
Dynasty Warriors: Godseekers Review;5;Mediocre; Dynasty Warriors: Godseekers eschews third-person action for turn-based strategy with mixed results.;Sean Bell has been pursuing Lu Bu for roughly 15 years now and somehow still isn‰Ûªt bored of it. Seriously, there might be something wrong with him.
The Walking Dead: The Telltale Series - A New Frontier Ep. 2: Ties That Bind Part Two Review;8;Great; The conclusion to The Ties That Bind is a gut-wrenching, gory masterpiece up there with the very best episodes of The Walking Dead.;Brett hit the road with Javy, Clem, and crew for about two hours while wrapping up Episode Two of the third season of The Walking Dead.
Silence Review;7;Good; Silence is a gorgeous point-and-click adventure that usually manages to make up for its lack of challenging puzzles with powerful imagery and emotion.;Leif Johnson writes about video games on a remote ranch near the Texas coast. For the purposes of this review, he completed Silence in 7 hours.
Killing Floor 2 Review;8;Great; Underneath the mayhem of Killing Floor 2 lies exciting wave-based combat and a rewarding progression system.;Miguel spent 20 hours playing through all of Killing Floor 2's maps several times over. He also spent time upgrading all of the classes, which meant trying out each and every weapon. Tripwire Interactive provided GameSpot with a complimentary copy of the game for the purpose of this review.
Shantae: Half-Genie Hero Review;8;Great; Shantae‰Ûªs back with old-school charm and a shiny new coat of paint.;Jason D‰ÛªAprile spent seven hours exploring Half-Genie Hero and is still trying to find a few lingering secrets. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game.
Werewolves Within Review;7;Good; Ubisoft's Werewolves Within is an exciting demo of VR's social capabilities, even if the final product is somewhat bare bones.;Don Saas spent way too much time in his youth watching professional liars ply their trade at the height of the poker boom and isn't sure if he should be proud of how many tricks of the trade he picked up. He spent eight hours with Werewolves Within for this review using a complementary code provided by Ubisoft.
Space Hulk: Deathwing Review;4;Poor; Space Hulk: Deathwing has great atmosphere and attitude, but is ultimately undone by its frustrating gameplay.;Brett ventured into the grim, dark future for about 15 hours in the course of writing this review. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game.
I Expect You to Die Review;8;Great; I Expect You to Die captures the tension, revelations, and exhilaration of a last-second escape in virtual reality.;Mike Mahardy died many times on his way to escape in I Expect You to Die. He can now defuse virtual bombs in 10 seconds flat. GameSpot was provided a copy of the game for review.
Sword Art Online: Hollow Realization Review;5;Mediocre; Sword Art Online is built on high-stakes drama and a compelling premise--Hollow Realization delivers on neither.;Janine Hawkins enjoys MMOs, RPGs, visual novels, and even a little bit of fan service from time to time. The MMO-themed PS2 game .hack//INFECTION made a big impression on her back in the day, though its sequels did not. She put about 50 hours into Sword Art Online: Hollow Realization for the purposes of this review.
Super Mario Run Review;7;Good; Mario's smartphone debut is a charming yet all-too-brief adventure.;Peter finished every level in Super Mario Run, played a handful of levels with Peach and Toad, and competed against Nintendo-made ghosts in Toad Rally before writing his review. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game by Nintendo.
Robinson: The Journey Review;7;Good; Crytek takes on dinosaurs and science fiction in Virtual Reality.;Jason spent about five hours trekking through jungles and tar pits, hiding from raptors, and marveling at giant herbivores and pterosaurs. He reviewed Robinson: The Journey with a copy of the game provided by Crytek
Dead Rising 4 Review;7;Good; Dead Rising's core combat remains simplistic, but the expanded open world, compelling central mystery, and added combo weapons refresh the formula enough for some light, bloody fun.;Scott razed the dead for roughly 20 hours across both the campaign and the new cooperative multiplayer mode. Capcom provided GameSpot with a copy of the game for this review.
Orwell Review;8;Great; A smart take on surveillance and a focus on player choice makes Orwell exciting, engaging, and discomforting.;James O‰ÛªConnor loves narrative-driven games, and should probably re-read Nineteen Eighty-Four soon. For this review, he put five hours into a first runthrough and two into a second. Review code was provided by publisher Surprise Attack.
Hitman Review;8;Great; Agent 47 returns in one of the best Hitman games in the franchise‰Ûªs history.;Killing people was Brett‰Ûªs business--and business was good--for more than 20 hours while he played Hitman for this review.
Cities: Skylines - Natural Disasters Review;7;Good; Catastrophes finally come to Cities: Skylines in the Natural Disasters add-on.;Brett watched the end of the world as he knew it over and over again for about a dozen hours while playing Cities: Skylines - Natural Disasters.
Final Fantasy 15 Review;8;Great; Final Fantasy XV's world is filled with natural splendor and harrowing dungeons that far outlive the shallow story about a prince and his cliched bodyguards.;Peter completed Final Fantasy XV's story in 35 hours on PlayStation 4. 30 hours later, he continues to travel around the continent of Eos in search of legendary weapons and beasts worthy of his sword. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game for the purpose of this review.
Watch Dogs 2 Review;8;Great; Watch Dogs 2 offers loads of entertainment in a playground-like rendition of San Francisco that rises above the first game's soggy, downtrodden atmosphere.;Peter spent almost 50 hours in Watch Dogs 2's ridiculous take on the San Francisco Bay Area. Ubisoft provided GameSpot with a complimentary copy of the game for the purpose of this review.
Planet Coaster Review;9;Superb; Planet Coaster is an exemplary amusement park management simulation with fantastic construction tools and a wealth of high-quality user-created content.;Edmond Tran has spent more than 45 hours playing Planet Coaster, building over a dozen parks. His favorite park mascot is Gulpee Rex, and he thinks Cosmic Cow should be locked away. A copy of the game was provided by Frontier Developments.
Oceanhorn Review;5;Mediocre; Oceanhorn pays respect to the top-down adventures of the past, but it doesn't do much to advance their ideas.;Justin Clark spent five hours cruising the sea for the dread monster Oceanhorn. He‰Ûªs made a sworn vow that, given enough money, he would pay to have Nobuo Uematsu score his life for a week. It‰Ûªs good to have goals. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary download code for the purpose of this review.
Dishonored 2 Review;8;Great; Dishonored's brand of creative stealth-action mayhem returns with excellent new weapons, powers, and gameplay options that overshadow a few late-game letdowns.;Scott initially completed the campaign as Corvo--mixing stealth and action as necessary--then started a pure stealth run with new protagonist Emily. He also collected every single rune and explored most of the side content. Publisher Bethesda provided a copy of the game for this review.
Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare Review;8;Great; Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare touches down with passable multiplayer, a tubular, neon-tinged zombie invasion, and the best campaign since the first Modern Warfare.;Miguel spent 8 hours on Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare's campaign and logged approximately 38 hours of multiplayer time, primarily on the PlayStation 4 version and partially on the Xbox One and PC versions. Of those multiplayer hours, 15 were spent at a four-day review event in San Francisco in a closed online environment, while the rest of the time was spent on live servers using final retail code provided in advance by Activision. He has played every mainline Call of Duty release since the first game in 2
Dragon Ball: Xenoverse 2 Review;7;Good; Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2‰Ûªs combat might not be top-tier, but it provides a strong enough foundation to let this fan fantasy shine.;Heidi‰Ûªs reviewed a lot of Dragon Ball games over her freelance career--though, admittedly, she didn‰Ûªt play the first Xenoverse. However, she put about 15 hours into Xenoverse 2, completing the single-player story and playing numerous online and offline quests. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy for review.
Tyranny Review;8;Great; The banality of evil is on full display in the dark and disturbing Tyranny.;Brett finished Tyranny in 25 hours using a copy of the game provided by Paradox Interactive.
The Last Guardian Review;9;Superb; The Last Guardian's peerless animation and character development bring a fascinating relationship between boy and beast to life.;Peter completed The Last Guardian in 13 hours using a copy of the game provided by Sony.
Butcher Review;8;Great; Butcher is a brutal action-platformer with an eye for clever level design and a commitment to excessive action.;Dan Starkey will always have a soft spot for '90s-inspired action games, especially if they don't take themselves too seriously. He played through each of Butcher's 20 levels on Hard (the default setting). GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game by Transhuman Design.
Pokemon Sun and Moon Review;8;Great; Despite its story stumbles, Pokemon Sun and Moon for Nintendo 3DS breathes new life into the 20-year-old franchise.;After around 30 hours, Justin became the Pokemon Master of Alola. A copy of Pokemon Sun and Moon were provided for this review by Nintendo.
Football Manager 2017 Review;7;Good; Smart refinements and an improved match engine mark a return to form for the long-running management sim.;Richard spent more than 100 hours unevenly split between pre-launch code and the final version of Football Manager 2017. There were equal amounts of fist pumping and hair pulling.
Dark Souls 3: Ashes of Ariandel Review;7;Good; A new painted world serves as the setting for the first Dark Souls III DLC--with a new host of goals, enemies, and loot, but not much else.;Miguel toured his level-130 character from Dark Souls III throughout every area of Ashes of Ariandel on the PlayStation 4. The playthrough took about 6 hours, not counting failed boss fights. He also used a level 85-character in the Steam version for a partial 3-hour playthrough. Complimentary review codes for both platforms were provided by Bandai Namco.
Batman - The Telltale Series: New World Order - Episode 3 Review;6;Fair; Inconsequential decisions suck the momentum out of Telltale's Batman series.;Tamoor played through Episode 3 multiple times to explore as many branches of the story as possible, but found there's not much different between them. Sad Batman.
Overcooked Review;8;Great; If you're looking for rewarding, high-pressure couch co-op, it's hard to beat Overcooked's wild yet accessible culinary juggling act.;Scott recruited various members of the GameSpot staff to help him test Overcooked. There was yelling. Lots of yelling. GameSpot purchased a copy of the game for this review.
World of Final Fantasy Review;6;Fair; World of Final Fantasy‰Ûªs cute character moments can only offset its various frustrations for so long.;Heidi played World of Final Fantasy for 42 hours before writing her review, using a copy of the game provided by the publisher.
Eagle Flight Review;7;Good; Eagle Flight offers a fun, competitive take on capture-the-flag that is completely unique to VR.;Jimmy beat the single-player campaign within four hours and played roughly four hours of the multiplayer. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game on the Oculus Rift for the purpose of this review.
WWE 2K17 Review;6;Fair; Refinements to its measured combat make for a better game, but problems still persist in key areas both in and outside the squared circle.;Richard started watching wrestling back before The Rock was cool. He spent more than 30 hours with WWE 2K17, and never found anything as good as Shinsuke Nakamura versus Sami Zayn from NXT TakeOver: Dallas. GameSpot was supplied a copy of the game from publisher 2K.
Civilization 6 Review;9;Superb; The series that cemented the 4X strategy formula continues to stand the test of time with a stellar entry that adds richness and depth in unexpected places.;Scott powered through four matches in around 60 hours, but still feels like there's a lot left for him to learn. Thankfully, even after all those hours, he's still excited to dive back in. Publisher 2K provided a complimentary download code for this review.
The Silver Case Review;5;Mediocre; Suda 51's first game finally debuts on Western shores, the game fails to deliver on its best concepts.;Justin Clark spent 30 hours on The Silver Case. Nothing he said about The Silver Case has put a dent in how bad he needs Killer7 HD to happen. GameSpot was provided a copy of the game by the publisher.
Titanfall 2 Review;9;Superb; Titanfall 2 is more measured and intelligent than its predecessor, but just as fluid and kinetic.;Mike Mahardy completed Titanfall 2's campaign in five hours, and spent four times as long playing every multiplayer mode. His favorite Titan is Scorch.
100ft Robot Golf Review;5;Mediocre; 100ft Robot Golf lives up to the hilarity of its premise in every way, except when it has to be a golf game.;Justin Clark played through all 36 holes of 100ft Robot Golf. He is, in fact, three squirrels and a manatee piloting a human suit.
Giant Machines 2017 Review;5;Mediocre; Driving huge vehicles can be cool in Giant Machines 2017, but it's a thrill that doesn't last long.;Jason D‰ÛªAprile spent about 5 hours across 14 missions generally moving at the speed of about a mile and a half an hour, which is basically how he drives normally.
Rise of the Tomb Raider Review;9;Superb; Lara Croft's new adventure blends gameplay and story into a seamless experience in a dangerous world.;Mike Mahardy spent 20 hours exploring Rise of the Tomb Raider's world. He still can't find enough coins to upgrade his bolt action rifle.
Battlefield 1 Review;9;Superb; EA‰Ûªs shooter franchise goes back in time to the end of the imperial age with spectacular results in both its single and multiplayer experiences.;Miguel amassed 35 hours of combat time in Battlefield 1‰Ûªs multiplayer while spending six hours on the campaign. 12 of those multiplayer hours were spent at a two-day review event in Los Angeles in a closed online environment while the rest of the time was spent on live servers using final retail codes. He has played every mainline Battlefield release since Battlefield 1942, as well as the two Bad Company spin-offs. Codes for the game on Xbox One, PS4, and PC were provided by EA.
Here They Lie Review;8;Great; Prog-rock album-cover aesthetics meets occult imagery in this gripping psychological horror excursion on PlayStation VR.;Miguel took approximately 4 hours to beat Here They Lie and played two additional hours on a second playthrough. He's a huge fan of Silent Hill 1 and 2 and the first two Fatal Frames. Code for the game and PlayStation VR hardware were provided by Sony.
Duke Nukem 3D: 20th Anniversary World Tour Review;5;Mediocre; The Duke is back in a somewhat new (but very familiar) 20th-anniversary world tour.;Brett blasted his way through the evil alien pigs, cats, and other extraterrestrial beasties of this 20th-anniversary take on Duke Nukem 3D for around 10 hours. GameSpot was provided with a copy of the game.
Shadow Warrior 2 Review;8;Great; Shadow Warrior 2's unfunny story gets in the way of an otherwise great game.;Mat played Shadow Warrior 2 alone and in co-op with a friend for about 10 hours. He played on PC with a code provided by the publisher.
PlayStation VR Worlds Review;6;Fair; Can PlayStation VR Worlds do for PSVR what Wii Sports did for the Wii?;Jimmy played through all of PlayStation VR Worlds, even though one experience made him motion sick. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game for the purpose of this review.
RIGS Mechanized Combat League Review;6;Fair; The PlayStation VR shooter from Killzone studio Guerrilla Games nails first-person VR controls, but stumbles over the smaller details;Justin got through a season and a half offline, a season online, and strongly preferred for the Hunter class. Sony provided a copy of the game and the PSVR hardware for this review.
Batman: Arkham VR Review;7;Good; More of a VR experiment than a game, Batman: Arkham VR is light on gameplay but full of moments that will leave a lasting impression.;Tamoor played Batman: Arkham VR on a PlayStation VR headset supplied by Sony. He played through the game three times and is now incorporating it to his morning routine. Start the day the Batman way.
Paper Mario: Color Splash Review;7;Good; Returning after a 9-year break from consoles, Paper Mario goes Bob Ross on countless Shy Guys by teaching them The Joys of Painting.;Miguel needed 25 hours to get through Paper Mario: Color Splash, which also included time spent trying to reach 100 percent colorization in all areas. He managed a 90 percent average. His favorite installment in the series is the original Paper Mario. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game for the purpose of this review.
Battlezone VR Review;7;Good; The arcade classic returns, bringing challenging, cooperative tank combat into modern virtual reality. The results are flawed but ultimately still fun.;Scott blasted his way through Battlezone VR's randomized campaign both solo and with a co-op buddy. GameSpot's PlayStation VR headset (as well as a copy of the game) was furnished by Sony.
Atlas Reactor Review;8;Great; Atlas Reactor is a turn-based PvP game inspired by XCOM and Dota that's refreshingly fun.;Leif Johnson writes about video games on a remote ranch near the Texas coast. Much like Atlas Reactor's heroes, he's a freelancer--and thus, he's sad that Trion didn't include any heroes who use keyboards or pens as weapons. For the purposes of this review, he spent about 20 hours with Atlas Reactor, both in the live version and in open beta.
Yo-Kai Watch 2 Review;5;Mediocre; Yo-kai Watch 2's new additions to the series' lore aren't enough to save this sequel from feeling like old, stale territory.;Alexa Ray Corriea enjoyed the first Yo-kai Watch and finished the main campaign of Yo-Kai Watch 2, as well as played around in multiplayer. Copies of both versions--Bony Spirits and Fleshy Souls--were provided by Nintendo for this review.
Gears of War 4 Review;7;Good; Gears of War 4 makes the best of the franchise's multiplayer modes, but delivers a lackluster campaign in the process.;Mike Mahardy found his groove with the gnasher shotgun again, and continued to use it across Gears of War 4's versus modes. Microsoft provided a copy of the game for review.
Mafia 3 Review;6;Fair; Though Mafia III's storytelling is exceptional in every way, it's not quite strong enough to compensate for dated gameplay, repetitive missions, and technical issues.;Scott marathoned Mafia III's single-player campaign in roughly 40 hours, though he's confident the game would have been stronger at a smartly edited 20 to 25 hours. He tested the game on Xbox One, PS4, and PC. All copies were provided by publisher 2K Games.
River City: Tokyo Rumble Review;7;Good; River City: Tokyo Rumble isn‰Ûªt terribly complex or difficult, but it‰Ûªs plenty of fun for its brief playtime.;It‰Ûªs been a long time since Heidi played River City Ransom, but she was glad to re-enter the world of Kunio and company once again. She played Tokyo Rumble for eight hours, completing many of the optional quests in the process, using a complimentary copy of the game provided by Natsume.
XCOM 2 Review;9;Superb; Firaxis' turn-based strategy sequel brings major improvements to the multilayered XCOM formula.;Over the course of 40 hours, Mike failed four XCOM campaigns. He refused to load earlier saves.
Sonic Boom: Fire and Ice Review;6;Fair; Sonic Boom: Fire & Ice is an enjoyable if easy platformer with a good sense of speed and a handful of fun mini-games.;Cassidee finished Sonic Boom: Fire and Ice in six hours before writing her review. GameSpot was provided with complementary copies of the game for the purpose of this review.
Destiny: Rise of Iron Review;6;Fair; In its third year, Destiny is showing signs of exhaustion, as it retreads old ground and struggles to find inspiration.;Mike spent more than 20 hours grinding for Hunter gear, often fighting some variation of Sepiks Prime. Bungie provided a copy of Rise of Iron for review.
Azure Striker Gunvolt 2 Review;8;Great; Azure Striker Gunvolt 2 is a satisfying experience that never lets up with its distinct, tightly-paced action and challenging platforming.;Matt played around 8 and a half hours of Azure Striker Gunvolt 2 before writing his review. He's a huge fan of the Mega Man series and 2D action games in general. Nintendo provided GameSpot with a copy of the game for this review.
FIFA 17 Review;9;Superb; FIFA's new story mode grabs the headlines, but its gameplay still makes the difference.;Nathan played FIFA 17 on Xbox One for nearly 20 hours and put three hours into a single manual passing tutorial that he still hasn't managed an A rating on yet. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game for the purpose of this review.
Until Dawn: Rush of Blood Review;5;Mediocre; Until Dawn: Rush of Blood is filled with spooky sights and sounds, but falls short of being truly scary or fun to play.;Peter played through Rush of Blood in less than two hours on the Normal difficulty setting using a copy of the game provided by Sony.
Batman - The Telltale Series: Children of Arkham - Episode 2 Review;6;Fair; Telltale gives Oswald Cobblepot some time in the limelight, but skimps on gameplay to do so.;Tamoor played Episode Two of Telltale's Batman series on PC. He found there were no noticeable performance issues.
Forza Horizon 3 Review;9;Superb; From brand-building to a relentless reward system, this fast and friendly driving adventure in Australia has it all.;While exploring all of Forza Horizon 3's modes, Miguel took 20 hours to complete the festival component of the campaign. He‰Ûªs still crossing his fingers for a Forza Horizon set along the Pacific coast of California, Oregon, and Washington. At least that would be less cliched than setting a Horizon festival in Ibiza. Microsoft provided GameSpot with complimentary download codes for the purpose of this review.
Pro Evolution Soccer 2017 Review;8;Great; PES is playing its best soccer in years, but it still struggles with features and online matches.;Nathan played PES 17 offline and online on PlayStation 4. He built a myClub team around James Rodriguez, and still hasn‰Ûªt really found his best position. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of PES 17 for the purpose of this review.
God Eater 2: Rage Burst Review;8;Great; An accomplished, remastered sequel to the first God Eater comes fully loaded with otherworldly beasts to kill.;Miguel spent 35 hours clearing God Eater 2: Rage Burst on PC while also spending a couple of hours on the PS4 version. GameSpot was provided with complimentary copies of the game for the purpose of this review.
Worms W.M.D. Review;8;Great; Worms W.M.D. marks a return to form for the classic turn-based strategy series.;Jason D‰ÛªAprile has been playing with his Worms since the original Amiga version. In this case, he spent at least eight hours blowing away well-armed annelids controlled by AI, online players, and himself, across the Xbox One and PC versions of the game. GameSpot was provided with complimentary copies of Worms W.M.D. for the purpose of this review.
NBA2K17 Review;9;Superb; NBA 2K17's gameplay and presentation are on a whole other level when it comes to representing sports in video games.;Mat hasn't played many entries in the NBA 2K series, but he loves basketball. Talk to him about the sport, and without fail, he'll let you know it was invented by a Canadian. He played NBA 2K17 for 15 hours on PlayStation 4 with a copy provided by the publisher.
Jotun Review;8;Great; Jaw dropping beauty and a hefty challenge await you in in the hallowed realm of Jotun.;With no small amount of luck, and hundreds of deaths, Justin Clark was able to complete Jotun‰Ûªs campaign. To his dismay, Chris Hemsworth was not the final boss.
World of Warcraft: Legion Review;9;Superb; World of Warcraft: Legion proves that Blizzard still has enough tricks up its sleeve to keep WoW relevant more than a decade after its initial release.;Don Saas has played World of Warcraft on and off since his freshman year of college during the Burning Crusade years, and spent 35 hours with Legion before writing his review. He tends to roll hunters and priests (Horde, naturally), but his toon for Legion was primarily a Demon Hunter. Lok'tar ogar.
SuperHyper Cube Review;6;Fair; SuperHyperCube is a simple-yet-difficult VR puzzle game set in a magical space, but VR doesn't benefit gameplay in a meaningful way.;Peter played SuperHyperCube for three hours but never managed to make it past the fourth group's puzzles, despite his best efforts. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game for the purpose of this review.
Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Spirit of Justice Review;8;Great; The latest courtroom adventure for the Wright Anything Agency may be its best yet, with a wide range of crime-solving tools and characters that create room for elaborate drama and ...;Alexa Ray Corriea has been with the Phoenix Wright series since its inception. She completed the full game for the purpose of this review with a copy provided by publisher Capcom.
The Final Station Review;7;Good; The Final Station is a 2D side-scrolling zombie survival game with enough challenging combat to offset its predictable pace.;Alex would totally panic in a zombie apocalypse, so don‰Ûªt depend on him to find survivors and hunt for food. It took him 10 hours to finish The Final Station. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game for the purpose of this review.
ReCore Review;6;Fair; ReCore's solid mechanics are sullied by frustrating quest design.;Tamoor played ReCore on Xbox One. He reached the final area of the game and will be spending the next few days finding those accursed Prismatic Cores, hoping there's something good behind the doors.
The Tomorrow Children Review;3;Bad; Resource gathering and city building have never been more tedious.;Scott slogged through The Tomorrow Children Founders Pack for 15 hours before he finally surrendered. A free-to-play version of the game is still forthcoming. GameSpot was provided a copy of the game for the purposes of this review.
Shin Megami Tensei 4: Apocalypse Review;9;Superb; This all-new adventure in the Shin Megami Tensei IV universe ranks among the best games for the 3DS.;Heidi‰Ûªs played every official English-language Shin Megami Tensei release, and SMTIV: Apocalypse is among the best. Now that she‰Ûªs seen the Anarchy ending, shes tempted to go back and see some of the other endings available in the game. Heidi reviewed the game using a complimentary download code provided by Atlus.
Valley Review;7;Good; Valley is an exciting experience in motion, but its momentum is cut short by the all too brief adventure.;Mat finished Valley in just under 3 hours with a copy of the game provided by the publisher.
Alone With You Review;8;Great; A cross between a visual novel and classic adventure game, Alone with You offers a strong and poignant narrative of love, tragedy, and relationships.;Jason D‰ÛªAprile can‰Ûªt resist a companion who loves to read and write, especially when stranded on a dying planet. He completed Alone With You using a complimentary download code provided by Sony.
Grow Up Review;5;Mediocre; Grow Up's frustrating physics and controls conflict with its charming presentation.;Jason D‰ÛªAprile spent eight hours getting stuck in high places with B.U.D. using a complimentary copy of the game provided by Ubisoft.
Obduction Review;7;Good; Obduction is a beautiful, unrelenting adventure game whose complex puzzles can be both satisfying and frustrating.;Edmond Tran completed Obduction in around 14 hours. He still has CD-ROM copies of Myst and Riven somewhere, but forgot the code to the cardboard box. He played Obduction using a complimentary code provided by the publisher.
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure: Eyes of Heaven Review;6;Fair; CyberConnect 2's latest Jojo's Bizarre Adventure brawler has some glaring issues, but series fans shouldn't hesitate to play this one.;Matt played nearly 25 hours of Eyes of Heaven and his current mains are Lisa Lisa and Kakyoin. He's proud to say he's a huge Jojo fan and has read nearly the entirety of the series except for some of the latest chapters of Jojolion. His favorite parts are Diamond is Unbreakable and Steel Ball Run. Yes, he's watching the current anime and he loves it to death.
NHL 17 Review;7;Good; The NHL series' gameplay continues to impress in NHL 17, but with only incremental upgrades, it feels like a game we've played before.;Mat is Canadian, which means it's against federal law for him to not consume hockey on a daily basis. He's played every NHL game since 2001, and spent 20 hours with the Xbox One version of NHL 17 with a copy provided by the publisher.
Attack on Titan Review;6;Fair; Attack on Titan's latest gameplay iteration doesn't win any technical achievements, but is a fun, faithful adaptation that can rope you in with its traversal alone.;Alexa Ray Corriea has watched the show and read the manga, and now that's she's beaten the campaign and swung around in multiplayer mode for Attack on Titan, she doesn't know if she can stand to look at one more giant naked man.
Mother Russia Bleeds Review;7;Good; Mother Russia Bleeds brings an older genre back into the limelight, with clever boss fights, intricate stage design, and complicated storytelling themes.;Mike Mahardy beat Mother Russia Bleeds alone and cooperatively, and as was the case with Double Dragon and River City Ransom, prefers having a friend along for the ride.
Master of Orion Review;7;Good; Despite some rough edges and frequent moments of boredom, Master of Orion is an engaging reboot of a classic sci-fi strategy title.;Mike Mahardy spent 25 hours exploring the stars and dismantling alien races in Master of Orion. GameSpot was provided a copy of the game by the publisher.
Deus Ex Go Review;8;Great; Deus Ex Go's hacking-based puzzle-solving is so satisfying it makes you feel smarter than the game itself.;Mat swiped through the story's puzzles in a couple of hours. Sadly, he did it with boring human hands instead of cool robot ones like Adam Jensen's. He reviewed Deus Ex Go on an iPad Air with a copy of the game provided by the publisher.
Kentucky Route Zero Act IV Review;9;Superb; Kentucky Route Zero returns with an episode that meanders, but enraptures all the same.;Justin Clark spent two and a half hours with Kentucky Route Zero's newest act. He sincerely hopes to one day have a story as good those told on Lethe Lake. Fewer electric skeletons running around would be a plus, though.
Bound Review;7;Good; What Bound lacks in challenging gameplay, it makes up for in breathtaking awe.;Justin Clark completed Bound in about three hours. He fully intends to play the game again when the PSVR patch hits and will spend his days until then hoarding Dramamine.
No Man's Sky Review;7;Good; No Man's Sky is a massive machine with broken and missing parts, but dig deep enough and you'll be moved in ways you never expected.;Peter played No Man's Sky for 40 hours on PS4, completing the Atlas quest and meandering planetside often enough to amass millions in currency and purchase new ships on a regular basis. GameSpot was provided with a copy of the game for the purpose of this review.
F1 2016 Review;8;Great; F1 2016 rewards reflexes and tactful driving to create the most authentic F1 game to date.;Danny often wakes up at silly hours of the morning to watch Formula One races taking place around the world. He co-hosts a Formula One podcast on Giant Bomb and splits his F1 gaming time between the Codemasters series and Project CARS. For this review, he spent 15 hours with F1 2016 across PS4, Xbox One, and PC, using complimentary codes provided by the publisher.
Inside Review;8;Great; Inside is a beautiful, haunting tale of survival and individuality with engaging puzzles and an intriguing world.;Alex Newhouse is a big fan of dystopian and post-apocalyptic fiction, and Inside's a great entry in the genre. He completed the game twice on Xbox One for this review with a copy provided by the developer.
Batman - The Telltale Series: Realm of Shadows - Episode 1 Review;8;Great; Telltale begins breaking down Bruce Wayne with a strong first episode.;Tamoor played Episode One on PC at a review event held by Telltale. He was vengeance, he was the night, he was Batman (for about two hours).
Deus Ex: Mankind Divided Review;8;Great; Deus Ex: Mankind Divided refines and reinforces the defining foundations of the series.;Edmond Tran played Mankind Divided on PC. He spent around 30 hours completing the campaign and nearly all side missions as a stealthy, pacifist hacker, before starting New Game+ and solving every problem with a revolver.
Metroid Prime: Federation Force Review;5;Mediocre; Metroid Prime: Federation Force plays it safe and drops the ball.;Peter completed Federation Force's campaign through a mixture of solo and cooperative play, with players local and online. He participated in a half-dozen matches of Blast Ball, and chalked every one of his goals up to luck. He reviewed Federation Force using a copy of the game provided by Nintendo.
The King of Fighters XIV Review;8;Great; The King of Fighters XIV may not impress you with its visuals, but the accessible-yet-complex mechanics make it a well-executed fighter worth your time.;"Matt played around 20 hours of The King of Fighters XIV before writing his review. His main team consists of K' (that's ""K Dash"" to you, pal!), Ralph, and Kyo. AtlusUSA provided GameSpot with a copy of the game for this review."
This is the Police Review;7;Good; This Is the Police is an enjoyable but flawed management sim that gives you a taste of what it's like to be the chief of police.;Alex enjoyed his time solving crimes and exposing corruption as police chief Jack Boyd. It took him 20 hours to finish This Is the Police. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game for this review.
Madden NFL 17 Review;8;Great; A new commentary duo and improvements to on-field maneuvers helps usher in a new and (mostly) improved Madden era, though it‰Ûªs not without its issues.;Having reviewed several Madden NFL games, Miguel was eager to see how Madden NFL 17 would stand out from past entries. He spent approximately 20 hours with the Xbox One version while also spot-checking the game on the PS4. As a San Francisco resident, he‰Ûªs keeping expectations low on the 49ers‰Ûª playoff chances. Miguel reviewed Madden NFL 17 using copies
Quadrilateral Cowboy Review;9;Superb; Quadrilateral Cowboy makes you feel like a skilled hacker in a memorable 1980‰Ûªs cyberpunk world.;Edmond Tran spent around 6 hours completing Quadrilateral Cowboy, taking time to replay some missions for faster runs. He recommends playing the game with a mechanical keyboard.
Necropolis Review;6;Fair; Roguelike hack-and-slasher Necropolis offers intense combat and a quirky setting, along with repetition, confusion, and permadeath difficulty.;Crawling through the polygonal dungeons of Necropolis occupied Brett for about six hours. He reviewed Necropolis with a copy of the game provided by the publisher.
Brigador Review;7;Good; Brigador is a destructive romp filled with explosions and death, brought to you by some of the coolest robots around.;Dan Starkey's been a fan of mecha--in both games and anime--for years. He indulged his inner 10-year-old and blew up wave after wave enemy mechs, completing Brigador's campaign and several additional missions for the sake of this review. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game.
I Am Setsuna Review;7;Good; I Am Setsuna proudly mimics classic Japanese RPGs, but at what cost?;Peter grew up playing Japanese RPGs in the '90s, and I Am Setsuna triggered nostalgic feelings for him on a near-constant basis. He completed the game, switching between Wait and Active modes on occasion. By the end of the story, his characters were at level 40 and above. He reviewed I Am Setsuna using a copy of the game provided by Square Enix.
Kerbal Space Program Review;9;Superb; Kerbal Space Program is a monumental, exhilarating, and frustrating gaming achievement worthy of admiration.;Justin Clark has put 57 hours into the final release of Kerbal Space Program so far. Countless spacecraft have exploded on his watch, but he's only killed four astronauts. He keeps waiting for the four of them to come back from deep space with The Power Cosmic, but still nothing. Modders, get on that.
The Assembly Review;5;Mediocre; The Assembly shows signs of promise, but it stumbles in its attempt to craft a compelling story.;Mat completed The Assembly in around four hours. He played the game inside and out of virtual reality and saw both endings. GameSpot was provided with a copy of the game for the purpose of this review.
Abzu Review;9;Superb; Abzu is deeply, transcendentally beautiful--not just visually splendid, but emotionally evocative. Without question, it is this year's Journey.;Scott spent roughly four hours savoring his time with the admittedly brief Abzu, but he plans on playing through again as soon as possible. GameSpot was provided a copy of the game for the purposes of this review.
Headlander Review;8;Great; Headlander's weird world overflows with color, power-ups, and personality.;Peter completed Headlander in about nine hours on PlayStation 4, and played two hours of the PC version, with copies of the game provided by the publisher.
God Eater Resurrection Review;6;Fair; A new version of Gods Eater Burst transitions to PlayStation 4 with mixed results.;Miguel brought in about 20 hours of prior God Eater and other monster-hunting experience to God Eater Resurrection. He needed about 30 hours to get through the story. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game for the purpose of this review.
Pokemon Go Review;7;Good; Nintendo‰Ûªs first major foray beyond its own platforms is an imaginative, socially-driven take on augmented reality gaming and location-based exploration.;Miguel brought in about 200 combined hours of Pokemon franchise experience before firing up Pokemon Go. Along with approximately five hours as a beta participant, Miguel put in about 15 hours in the public version of Pokemon Go, where he endured two unanticipated account resets.
Monster Hunter Generations Review;8;Great; The latest installment in Capcom's popular monster-slaying franchise adds exciting ways to stay alive, but it doesn't solve the series long-standing issues.;Justin spent about 60 hours playing Monster Hunter Generations on a New Nintendo 3DS. His primary weapon in 4 Ultimate was the Charge Blade, but for Generations he went with Sword & Shield.
Breached Review;3;Bad; Breached wants to evoke the sci-fi survivalism of The Martian but fails to get off the ground.;Don loves existentialist sci-fi and will talk your ear off about the genius of Tarkovsky's Stalker if you let him. Don spent about four and a half hours with the game over three complete playthroughs. GameSpot was provided with a copy of the game for the purpose of this review.
Videoball Review;8;Great; Simple and stunningly fun multiplayer, both online and off, makes Videoball one of the surprise hits of the year.;Jason D‰ÛªAprile is also very retro, so he enjoyed busting out cool moves against pesky AI, complete strangers, and a certain precocious eight year old who beat him at Minecraft‰Ûªs Battle mode the other day. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game for the purpose of this review.
Song of the Deep Review;6;Fair; Though its patience-testing puzzles hit a few sour notes, Song of the Deep still delivers a rich, imaginative undersea adventure.;Scott explored Song of the Deep's watery world for roughly nine hours, though completionists could spend even more tracking down all its hidden treasures. Publisher GameTrust provided GameSpot with a copy of the game for this review.
Furi Review;8;Great; Furi is a beautiful and challenging game that exemplifies what makes boss fights so special.;Peter beat Furi twice on the default difficulty before writing his review. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game for the purpose of this review.
7th Dragon III Code: VFD Review;8;Great; 7th Dragon III‰Ûªs extensive party customization and pleasing difficulty make for a great portable RPG.;Heidi wandered in the world of 7th Dragon III for 50 hours, travelling all across time in the process. She has one burning question, however: why don‰Ûªt male Lucier also have cute kitty ears? GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy for the purpose of this review.
I Get This Call Every Day Review;7;Good; Repetitive, aggravating, soul-destroying, and an experience everyone on either side of the telephone needs to have.;Justin Clark spent an hour navigating the impenetrable abyss of Billy J. Swarth‰Ûªs mind. At which point, he refused to continue until someone paid him $15 an hour. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game for this review.
The Technomancer Review;6;Fair; The Technomancer is a jack of all RPG trades, master of none.;Jason D‰ÛªAprile walked across Mars numerous times--boosting his electrical staff skills, locating missing people, delivering messages, and stomping on bugs--over the course of 10 hours. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game for the purpose of this review.
Ghostbusters Review;3;Bad; Ghostbusters fulfills your worst expectations of licensed games.;Jason D‰ÛªAprile is saddened by the six or so hours of his life he‰Ûªs never getting back after playing this game. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game for the purposes of this review.
7 Days to Die Review;2;Terrible; 7 Days to Die is a bad console port of an unfinished game.;Joab Gilroy is staying alive. Ah, ah, ah, ah, staying alive. He spent 18 hours playing 7 Days to Die, and only 10% of it was spent loading. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game for the purposes of this review.
Asemblance Review;5;Mediocre; Asemblance promises plenty of drama, but can‰Ûªt deliver.;Jason D‰ÛªAprile spent way too many hours walking through the same memories over and over in hopes of finding a point. Sadly, he failed. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game for the purpose of this review.
Umbrella Corps Review;3;Bad; Umbrella Corps is a sloppy competitive shooter with a score of issues that overshadow its redeeming qualities.;Peter spent eight hours with Umbrella Corps. He played a dozen single player missions and got his online profile to level ten. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game for the purpose of this review.
The Division: Underground Expansion Review;7;Good; With its customizable missions and randomly generated areas, Underground's Operations breathe new life into an ailing game.;Scott spent another 20 hours in The Division, exploring New York's infested subways and assembling exotic new gear sets. Ubisoft provided a copy of the game, though GameSpot purchased its own season pass.
Space Run Galaxy Review;8;Great; Tower defense goes to the stars with Space Run Galaxy, a game that blends tactical thinking, twitch action, and starship trucking.;Brett hauled cargo across the galaxy for 10 hours before writing his review. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game for the purpose of this review.
Dead by Daylight Review;6;Fair; Dead by Daylight can get its hooks in you, but it might not get you to stick.;Joab Gilroy's a survivor. He's not gon' give up. He's not gon' stop. He's gon' work harder. For the purposes of this review he played for 20 hours and sacrificed 200+ unlucky souls.
The Solus Project Review;5;Mediocre; The Solus Project's story and survival mechanics look promising at first, but they ultimately fail to meet expectations.;Mat completed The Solus Project in 10 hours. He explored for a bit and even tried out the experimental VR mode, though he got motion sick shortly after he started moving. GameSpot was provided with a copy of the game for the purpose of this review.
Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens Review;7;Good; Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens doesn't take the Lego series to new places, but is still a solid and enjoyable romp for families and Star Wars fans.;Randy completed the story and played a few of the unlockable side missions in his roughly eight hours of play with Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens. GameSpot was provided a copy of the game from Warner Bros. for review.
Star Ocean: Integrity and Faithlessness Review;5;Mediocre; Star Ocean's return is a bumpy ride, with slick combat and smart upgrade systems bogged down by a watery story and some frustrating technical designs.;Alexa Ray Corriea spent more than 30 hours exploring Star Ocean: Integrity and Faithlessness, completing the main quest and numerous side stories. A copy of the game was provided by Square Enix.
Zero Escape: Zero Time Dilemma Review;6;Fair; Despite a slew of problems, Zero Escape: Zero Time Dilemma uses complex story techniques in a suspenseful tale about human nature.;Mike Mahardy played Zero Escape: Zero Time Dilemma for 12 hours, and could only stand about three characters. Nintendo provided a copy of the game.
Duskers Review;8;Great; Duskers is a cohesive science fiction simulation which is punishingly difficult, but a pleasure to master.;Jason Imms has jumped between countless systems in search of humanity and has found none. You‰Ûªd think this would dampen his spirits, but as it turns out he really enjoys bending drones to his will via a command line interface. Do what you love, and all that. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game for the purpose of this review.
Dangerous Golf Review;4;Poor; Dangerous Golf is a game for people who yearn for destruction, however shallow.;Peter unlocked every location in Dangerous Golf before writing his review. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game by Three Fields Entertainment.
Tropico 5 Penultimate Edition Review;7;Good; Tropico 5 is a clever, tongue-in-cheek riff on tiny, dictatorial countries, and its console port is an excellent counterpart to the modern PC classic.;Daniel Starkey loves city building games. As tests of organization and logistical management, they're among his favorite time sinks. He spent 23 hours building up his dynasty in Tropico 5 with a copy provided by the developer.
Edge of Nowhere Review;8;Great; Edge of Nowhere is a thrilling trip to the Antarctic, punctuated by disturbing horrors and hallucinations.;Peter played through Edge of Nowhere in one four-hour session. Insomniac Games provided GameSpot with a complimentary copy of the game for the purpose of this review.
Sherlock Holmes: The Devil's Daughter Review;6;Fair; Sherlock‰Ûªs powers of deduction are as enthralling as ever, but middling action gets in the way.;It took Richard around eight hours to sleuth his way through Sherlock‰Ûªs five cases. He especially dislikes the monotonous bar fight in the third case, but admits that having to play dress-up was quite fun.
Hearts of Iron 4 Review;8;Great; The king of World War II-era grand strategy has returned with more engaging choices and a streamlined interface.;Daniel Starkey ran through two campaigns. His first, as England, ended in a swift defeat. His second, with the aid of an extensive nuclear bombing campaign against Germany and the Soviet Union was a resounding success. Along the way he managed to shuffle millions of men and tons of ammunition and supplies around the world to support his war effort. He received a copy of the game from publisher Paradox interactive.
The Way Review;6;Fair; The Way is a thought-provoking tale about life and death, but its lackluster gameplay continually frustrates.;It took Alex 10 hours to finish The Way, and though he loved solving the game's opening puzzles, he had a hard time staying engaged towards the end. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game for this review.
Trials of the Blood Dragon Review;7;Good; Two great flavors that go pretty well together.;Justin Clark was able to get through all the main missions of Trials of the Blood Dragon within about 3 hours. He stopped counting his failed runs after about an hour or so. It‰Ûªs for the best.
Mighty No. 9 Review;5;Mediocre; Mighty No. 9 is occasionally fun and inventive, but it fails to leave a lasting impression.;Peter completed Mighty No. 9 and played most of the its challenge stages on PS4. He also tested a few levels on Xbox One. GameSpot was provided with complimentary copies of the game for the purpose of this review.
Mirror's Edge Catalyst Review;7;Good; Catalyst's combat stumbles, but the fluid freerunning and enticing open-world challenges overshadow most of its shortcomings.;Scott dashed through Catalyst's campaign in roughly 14 hours, but happily explored the copious side content for at least another six. Also, yes, he did play and enjoy the original Mirror's Edge. Publisher EA provided copies of the game for this review.
Odin Sphere Leifthrasir Review;8;Great; Odin Sphere returns in a beautiful package sure to bring glee to even the most jaded among us.;Kevin VanOrd will soon be joining Larian Studios to write for Divinity: Original Sin 2, and is also working with Cleaversoft as a designer for the upcoming EarthNight. He was glad to find 40 hours or so to spend with Odin Sphere Leifthrasir. He‰Ûªd love to see Vanillaware‰Ûªs strategy game GrimGrimoire also get the HD treatment, though he isn‰Ûªt holding his breath.
Tokyo Mirage Sessions #FE Review;8;Great; Tokyo Mirage Sessions #FE is a smart, fun collaboration between two franchises that feel like they were always meant to be together.;Alexa Ray Corriea is deeply familiar with the Shin Megami Tensei and Fire Emblem series. She completed the campaign of Tokyo Mirage Sessions and many of its side quests for this review, with a copy provided by publisher Nintendo.
Excubitor Review;8;Great; Excubitor is a fun and frantic mix of old school shooting and tower defense gameplay.;Jason D‰ÛªAprile is a fan of old-school scrolling shooters, and is still replaying levels in Excubitor after nearly 20 hours.
Hitman Go VR Review;6;Fair; Hitman Go comes to virtual reality, yet doesn't do enough to justify the new technology.;Mat's played the original Hitman GO on iPad in the past, and spent a few hours with Hitman GO VR for the purpose of this review.
Duelyst Review;8;Great; In a tide of games trying to capitalize on Hearthstone's success, Duelyst still stands out.;Janine Hawkins isn't a hardcore competitor, but she's still susceptible to the charms of a well-built strategy game. She spent time with each of Duelyst's factions but employed a custom Abyssian deck for the majority on her online matches.
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Blood and Wine Review;8;Great; The Witcher 3: Blood and Wine concludes Geralt‰Ûªs latest saga with memorable quests, fearsome battles, and surprising wit.;Kevin finished Blood and Wine in about 40 hours, finishing the main quest, almost every side quest, fully upgrading his vineyard, and unlocking almost every signpost. He was glad he was so thorough: there was so much to discover in the duchy of Toussaint. Kevin VanOrd is soon off on a new game design adventure: he will be joining the fine team at Larian Studios to work on Divinity: Original Sin 2. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game for the purpose of this review.
Overwatch Review;9;Superb; Overwatch meshes vastly different ideas and schools of thought into one frantic, exhilarating, layered shooter.;Mike Mahardy spent 70 hours playing as every hero in Overwatch, and plans to play many more. His favorite characters are Zarya and McCree. Blizzard provided a copy of Overwatch for review.
Kirby: Planet Robobot Review;8;Great; Kirby's latest adventure is one of his best yet, packed with variety of charming moments and an impressive attention to detail.;Peter finished Planet Robot's story mode, Kirby 3D Rumble, the boss rush arena in the span of 8 hours. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game for the purpose of this review.
Party Hard Review;7;Good; Party Hard takes a disturbing premise and makes it silly.;Alex likes to sleep, but he's not going to murder the neighbors for disturbing his peaceful rest. It took him 8 hours to finish Party Hard. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game for this review.
Fallout 4 Far Harbor Review;6;Fair; Far Harbor takes Fallout 4 to the blustering coast of Maine with mixed results.;Peter finished Far Harbor's main storyline and dabbled in side quests over the course of 10 hours. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game for the purpose of this review.
Doom Review;8;Great; Doom doesn't shy away from the spirit that drove its forebearers to greatness;
Alienation Review;8;Great; Housemarque's Alienation delivers an excellent multiplayer shooter with timeless appeal.;Jason D‰ÛªAprile is still killing aliens in a quest to reach level 30 and unlock hero mode after almost 15 hours of play time.
The Magic Circle: Gold Edition Review;7;Good; The Magic Circle is a fascinating, satirical look at life beyond the polygon curtain.;Justin Clark was able to get through the core game in about two and a half hours, and spent more hours than he‰Ûªs comfortable admitting fiddling around with the endgame.
Tastee: Lethal Tactics Review;7;Good; Despite some visual impediments and a mediocre interface, Tastee delivers intelligent turn-based combat in a variety of intense scenarios.;Mike Mahardy completed Tastee: Lethal Tactics single player missions, and lost a handful of missions to far better players in multiplayer. GameSpot was provided a copy of the game for review.
Stellaris Review;7;Good; Stellaris gives you the stars as your playground, proving that Paradox capably translates some of their strategy game prowess into space.;Daniel Starkey spread his people across the stars, eager to uncover long-held mysteries. He spent 30 hours with the game over a week playing with his favorite race: the Molluscoid Reapers. GameSpot was provided with a copy of Stellaris for the purpose of this review.
Soft Body Review;8;Great; Soft Body is a bizarre, captivating puzzle action game with great visual effects and challenging gameplay.;Cassidee applied her knowledge of bullet hell and puzzle games during the handful of hours she spent on Soft Body. Her review copy of the game was provided by the publisher.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants in Manhattan Review;4;Poor; Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants in Manhatten is both basic and overly complex, delivering almost none of the magic that made previous four-player Turtles games so memorable.;Justin Clark was able to get through the campaign in about five hours, with an extra hour or two to find the secret bosses and try four-player co-op. A lifelong fan of the Turtles, especially in video game form, he would like to take this time to remind scientists that they have four more years to get us closer to the future promised in the Neon Night Riders stage from Turtles In Time. Just sayin‰Ûª, humanity. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game for the purpose of this review.
Shadow of the Beast Review;5;Mediocre; A reimagining of a cult classic is beset by uninspired level designs and unrefined combat.;Miguel beat Shadow of the Beast‰Ûªs seven chapters, and went back to play a few after beating the game. He also spent time exploring the bonus content. He‰Ûªs had prior experience with the series, having played the Genesis version of Shadow of the Beast. GameSpot was provided with a copy of the game for the purpose of this review.
Homefront: The Revolution Review;5;Mediocre; Despite its ambitious premise, Homefront's efforts to reclaim Philadelphia are sabotaged by technical issues, faulty mechanics, and predictable storytelling.;Scott completed the campaign on PS4 in roughly 25 hours before moving on to PC and Xbox One. He spent an additional 10 hours in co-op. Publisher Deep Silver provided copies of the game for this review.
Galak-Z: The Void Review;6;Fair; Galak-Z: The Void maintains The Dimensional's frantic combat, but uses it to lesser effect.;Mike Mahardy spent 10 hours chasing high scores in The Void, and competed in several daily challenges. 17-Bit provided a review copy of the expansion.
Battleborn Review;7;Good; Gearbox Software's first major IP since Borderlands borrows that series' shooting but confuses the proceedings with an overwhelming array of ideas. Can 25 heroes save the day?;Scott beat all eight campaign missions, spent time with all 25 heroes, and lost a bunch in all three multiplayer modes, which added up to approximately 30 hours of play time. He reviewed this game using copies provided by publisher 2K.
Chronos Review;8;Great; Chronos not only delivers highly enjoyable combat opportunities, it also sets the stage for third-person action-adventure games in virtual reality.;Mat doesn't know how much time he spent with Chronos because he loses track of time when he's in virtual reality. His character died enough times to see her 65th birthday, and he blames the last 15 deaths on that damned dragon.
Uncharted 4: A Thief's End Review;10;Essential; Uncharted 4: A Thief's End blends its gameplay, characters, and world into a magnificent whole, making it the best game in the series, and a new watermark for storytelling.;Mike Mahardy beat Uncharted 4's story mode in 14 hours. He has since played multiplayer, bullet time mode, and turned the cel-shading filter on. Sony provided a copy of the game for review.
Total War: Warhammer Review;9;Superb; The Warhammer universe blends with the tactical gameplay of Total War to create one of the best real-time strategy games ever.;Daniel Startkey's been a fan of the Total War series for years. He spent several days going through a full campaign with the Vampire counts and running through a few hours with the other races. He also ran a couple dozen skirmishes including several online multiplayer matches with the developers. He received a copy of the game from Sega for the purposes of this review.
The Walking Dead: Michonne - Episode 3: What We Deserve Review;8;Great; Telltale‰Ûªs miniseries comes to an emotional end.;Justin Clark got through the finale twice, once with a critical character alive, one dead. He‰Ûªs pretty sure he‰Ûªs ready to go back to Clementine, now. For the levity.
Severed Review;8;Great; Severed's distinct look and touchscreen controls make it more than your average dungeon crawler.;Jason D‰ÛªAprile generally avoids severing limbs unless it‰Ûªs really necessary, but he did so countless times during the 12 hours it took him to beat Severed. GameSpot was provided with a copy of the game for the purpose of this review.
Invisible Inc. Console Edition Review;8;Great; Invisible, Inc. is a wonderful turn-based stealth game that deftly balances simplicity with depth.;Kevin VanOrd doesn‰Ûªt write about games as much as he used to, now that he makes them instead. But he certainly enjoyed writing about Invisible, Inc. after the 18 hours or so he spent with it. He‰Ûªs currently working with Cleaversoft on EarthNight. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game for the purpose of this review.
The Aquatic Adventure of the Last Human Review;8;Great; The Aquatic Adventure of the Last Human offers challenging boss battles and serene exploration in a vast, beautiful world.;Mat spent nearly six hours under the sea, searching for audio tapes and taking on the bosses of The Aquatic Adventure of the Last Human. He quickly learned that he didn't have to hold his breath just because the game took place underwater.
Offworld Trading Company Review;9;Superb; Offworld Trading Company trades nukes and armies for stocks and commodities--without losing any of the thrill.;Dan Starkey spent more than 20 hours playing 30 games and two full campaigns of Offworld Trading Company. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game for this review.
Ashes of the Singularity Review;4;Poor; Ashes of the Singularity is a big and bold 4X strategy game, but if you‰Ûªre looking for much beyond scale, you‰Ûªll be sorely disappointed.;Daniel Starkey is still on the search for the perfect RTS. For the purposes of this review he played through the campaign and dipped into some skirmishes before dusting of his old Supreme Commander disc and replaying one of his favorites.
Star Fox Zero Review;7;Good; The first full-fledged Star Fox game in years mixes classic stylings with unconventional controls. But does it deliver?;Peter has been an avid fan of Star Fox fan since the series' debut on Super Nintendo. Using a copy of the game provided by Nintendo, he played through Star Fox Zero's campaign twice before writing his review.
P.O.L.L.E.N Review;5;Mediocre; Pollen seems to want to say something, but clarity isn‰Ûªt its strong suit.;"Jason Imms loves a good ""walking simulator"". Also a good adventure game. He just generally prefers them to have something to say. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game for purpose of this review."
The Banner Saga 2 Review;8;Great; The Banner Saga 2 is a successful adventure whose world-building and tactical combat stands strong, as is enhanced by experience with its predecessor.;Edmond Tran imported his save game and took about 12 hours to finish The Banner Saga 2, after which he immediately went back through the original again, making different choices, eager to play it all again.
Stranger of Sword City Review;5;Mediocre; Stranger of Sword City does much to stand out from the herd, but it might not be for the better.;Justin Clark spent 34 hours wandering the wastelands with his motley crew. He is still dumbfounded how the blacksmith is able to stay in business with his outrageous pricing model. GameSpot was provided a copy of the game for the purpose of this review.
Salt and Sanctuary Review;8;Great; This combat-intensive adventure manages to be more than the sum of its Dark Souls-influenced parts.;Miguel beat Salt and Sanctuary and explored much of its optional content over the course of 16 hours. GameSpot was provided a copy of the game for the purpose of this review.
Baldur's Gate: Siege of Dragonspear Review;8;Great; Baldur‰Ûªs Gate gets an impressive expansion in Siege of Dragonspear, a new D&D epic that fills some blanks in the original saga after nearly 20 years.;Brett visited the Forgotten Realms for around 35 hours en route to dealing with Caelar Argent and her minions.
Dead Star Review;7;Good; Dead Star takes old-school space shooter action into the multiplayer age.;Jason D'Aprile has been destroying things in virtual space since the original Star Wars, and spent over 20 hours doing so in Dead Star on PlayStation 4. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game for the purpose of this review.
Hyper Light Drifter Review;9;Superb; The stunning Hyper Light Drifter is a masterful mix of exploration and combat.;Kevin VanOrd used to work at GameSpot. Now he just writes sometimes. When he isn‰Ûªt writing, he‰Ûªs making games, and hoping they turn out to be even half as good as Hyper Light Drifter. He‰Ûªs still amazed that people can string 1,000 drifts together. He can barely make it to 200. Kevin is currently working with Cleaversoft as a designer on Earthnight.
Grim Dawn Review;8;Great; Hack and slash your way through the brilliantly realized horror-fantasy world of Grim Dawn, an instant classic in the action RPG genre.;Brett waded through the blood of Grim Dawn for over 40 hours before writing this review, and he‰Ûªs still going back for more.
Hitman Episode Two Review;7;Good; The second episode of Hitman takes place in a picturesque seaside destination, offering a very different atmosphere than the previous episode. But does it make for a better experience?;Peter ran through Sapienza's main mission twice, and played through the two available escalation missions before writing his review. GameSpot was provided with a copy of the game for the purposes of this review.
Enter the Gungeon Review;7;Good; Enter the Gungeon is a challenging roguelike with awesome ideas that often contradict one another.;Cassidee is a fan of roguelikes, especially ones with unique hooks like Rogue Legacy and Heavy Bullets. She spent about twelve hours raiding the Gungeon with a copy provided by the publisher.
The Walking Dead: Michonne - Episode 2: Give No Shelter Review;9;Superb; Michonne‰Ûªs second solo outing finally gets down to business.;Justin Clark played through Give No Shelter twice, and to the sleeping cat and downstairs neighbors he startled at the line ‰ÛÏPeek-a-boo‰Û, he is dreadfully sorry.
Ratchet & Clank Review;8;Great; Ratchet & Clank is a veritable power fantasy fueled by rockets and carried by specialty gadgets.;Cassidee is a longtime Ratchet & Clank fan and completed a full play through in about eight hours. This review was conducted using a copy provided by the publisher.
MLB The Show 16 Review;8;Great; Another year of subtle improvements and gameplay additions make MLB The Show 16 a must-buy for baseball fans.;MLB The Show 16 rings in the start of a new season of baseball, and another week of Brett digging his cleats into virtual dirt. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game for the purpose of this review.
Bravely Second: End Layer Review;7;Good; Despite a cloying story and poor dialogue, Bravely Second is a sweeping adventure.;Mike Mahardy spent 65 hours in Luxendarc, and continued grinding for the Yokai Job in the after hours. GameSpot was provided a review copy of End Layer by Square Enix.
Lucky's Tale Review;5;Mediocre; Oculus Rift enhances the familiar platforming in Lucky's Tale, but the VR adventure fails to leave a lasting impression.;Peter is well-versed in 3D platformers, and the two hours it took him to beat Lucky's tale felt like a walk down memory lane. Oculus provided GameSpot with access to Lucky's Tale for the purpose of this review.
Into the Stars Review;6;Fair; Into the Stars delivers intense Roguelite space strategy, but reveals all of its cards too soon.;Don Saas is a a sucker for Roguelikes and space strategy games. Into the Stars made him want to immediately rewatch Battlestar Galactica. He spent just over 10 hours with the game for this review.
Trackmania Turbo Review;7;Good; Trackmania Turbo delivers thrills online and off thanks to high speed, crazy tracks, and a unique time trial focus.;Jason D'Aprile has enjoyed beating his track times in this series for years, but is happy to finally go full Turbo on the big screen. Ubisoft provided GameSpot with access to the game for the purposes of this review.
Dark Souls 3 Review;8;Great; Dark Souls 3 is a harrowing trek through a dark and gorgeous world, and despite a few missteps, is well worth the challenge.;Mike Mahardy completed his first Dark Souls III playthrough in 23 hours. He spent another 20 hours on subsequent playthroughs and secret areas. He plans on making a Deprived run soon. Bandai Namco provided a copy of Dark Souls III for review.
Quantum Break Review;6;Fair; Quantum Break looks slick, but bouts of ineffective gameplay and its mixed-media construction make this a hit-and-miss experience.;Peter finished Quantum Break and went back to change his decisions in a few spots to measure the impact--and as an excuse to jump back into combat. Microsoft provided GameSpot with a copy of Quantum Break for the purpose of this review.
Slain Review;5;Mediocre; Slain is a gorgeous spectacle that‰Ûªs a total drag to play.;Alex Gilyadov enjoys a good 2D action-platformer. It took him 10 hours to finish Slain! GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game for purpose of this review.
Black Desert Online Review;7;Good; Much of Black Desert Online is a convoluted mess, but few games let you create a virtual life this absorbing.;Kevin VanOrd is no stranger to massively multiplayer games, having played more than he can count--and having worked on one, too. He played about 80 hours of Black Desert Online, and promises they weren‰Ûªt all spent fishing. When he isn‰Ûªt busy making more games, he writes about them here and there. His favorite MMOG of all time is Anarchy Online. There will probably never be an Anarchy Online 2, but he can always hope. Kevin is currently work with Cleaversoft as a designer on Earthnight.
Dirt Rally Review;8;Great; Dirt Rally‰Ûªs arrival on consoles lets more people join in Codemasters‰Ûª celebration of this brutal motorsport.;Richard has spent almost a year playing the different iterations of Dirt Rally. He noticed no discernible differences between the PC and PlayStation 4 versions.
EA Sports UFC 2 Review;7;Good; Hard-hitting and visually arresting, EA Sports UFC 2 refines its brutal action while still retaining some notable flaws.;Richard played UFC 2 on Xbox One for more than 15 hours. He found it a little weird playing as CM Punk.
Hyrule Warriors Legends Review;7;Good; Squeezed into a 3DS, do the thousands-strong battles hold up in handheld form?;Ian played Hyrule Warriors on trains throughout London for about 14-16 hours. You may have seen him swearing at his 3DS on the Overground.
Cities: Skylines Snowfall Review;7;Good; A winter wonderland comes to Cities: Skylines in the Snowfall DLC, a pleasing if pricey expansion featuring snow plows and hockey rinks.;Brett put on his virtual mayor‰Ûªs sash for another eight hours and waded into the icy tundra of Cities: Skylines Snowfall. He received a complimentary copy of the game for this review.
Republique Review;8;Great; Republique comes to PS4 as a complete package, and the game is all the better for it.;Justin Clark completed Republique Remastered in 10 hours on PlayStation 4. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game for this review.
Galactic Civilizations III: Mercenaries Review;4;Poor; Mercenaries is a disappointing expansion to last year's Galactic Civilizations III that limits your freedom on the battlefield.;Daniel Starkey loves playing with pretend space-orcs and faceless aliens in 4X strategy games, and he spent 20 hours tinkering with the new content in Mercenaries. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the expansion for this review.
Moon Hunters Review;5;Mediocre; Moon Hunters has a good story to tell, but grinds it to dust in the process.;Moon Hunters has a good story to tell, but grinds it to dust in the process.
Adr1ft Review;5;Mediocre; Adr1ft is a gorgeous game with a moving personal story, but its systems clash against one another, creating tedium and boredom throughout.;Mike Mahardy finished Adr1ft in six hours, with an additional two on Oculus VR. GameSpot was provided review code for Adr1ft from 505 Games.
Samorost 3 Review;7;Good; The studio behind imaginative indie hits Machinarium and Botanicula debuts its most ambitious game yet: a beautiful yet simplistic point-and-click adventure.;Scott took his time with Samorost 3 and still completed the game--including the majority of its side puzzles--in roughly six hours. He received a complimentary Steam code for this review.
Tom Clancy's The Division Review;8;Great; Despite oddly overpowered enemies and repetitive level grinding, The Division succeeds thanks to its rich world, strong campaign, and impressive online functionality.;Scott spent more than 50 hours pretending to be Snake Plissken in The Division this week, and he's since gone back for more. His copy of the game was furnished by publisher Ubisoft.
Shardlight Review;6;Fair; Shardlight is a solid old-school adventure game with an overly familiar premise.;Alex Gilyadov has been playing adventure games since the tender age of five. It took him roughly eight hours to finish Shardlight. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game for this review.
Casey Powell Lacrosse 16 Review;5;Mediocre; In trying to capture the essence of a precise sport, Casey Powell Lacrosse instead results in a tedious grind against poor AI and frustrating controls.;Mike Mahardy played real lacrosse for eight years, and Casey Powell Lacrosse 16 for 12 hours. A copy of the game was provided by Big Ant Studios.
Pokken Tournament Review;9;Superb; Bandai Namco has crafted a fighting game that is deep and rewarding, while also being accessible.;Tamoor‰Ûªs Pokken character of choice is Gengar. It has been crowned champion of the Ferrum League and put Mewtwo in his place multiple times. Respect it.
Dariusburst: Chronicle Saviours Review;8;Great; If it‰Ûªs high-quality arcade-style action you want, Dariusburst Chronicle Saviours has you covered.;Heidi has put over 50 hours into Dariusburst: Chronicle Saviours across PC, PS4, and Vita, with plenty of challenges left to tackle.
Fortified Review;6;Fair; Fortified has an impressive pulp sci-fi pedigree and speedy co-op play, but the blending of shoot-em-up and tower defense gameplay stumbles.;Brett spent about seven hours saving 1950s America from martian invaders, and is waiting patiently for his ticker-tape parade. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of Fortified for this review.
The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess HD Review;9;Superb; Nintendo‰Ûªs dark open-world epic dazzled fans when first released in 2006, but can this Wii U remaster do the same?;Rob played Twilight Princess in normal mode for about 40 hours, mixing between GamePad and Pro Controller. He played hero mode briefly, but wasn‰Ûªt able to play the new Amiibo dungeon.
Far Cry Primal Review;8;Great; Far Cry's new world and renewed focus on survival create a tense experience true to its setting, with higher detail on PC.;Mike Mahardy spent about 30 hours riding mammoths, burning villages, and crafting spears in Far Cry Primal on PS4, Xbox One, and PC. Both console copies were provided by Ubisoft.
Devil Daggers Review;8;Great; Devil Daggers compresses the shooter experience into a focused microcosm, stretching seconds into their own hectic chapters.;Mike Mahardy played Devil Daggers for four hours before breaking 120 seconds. He plans on playing more.
Gears of War: Ultimate Edition Review;6;Fair; Gears of War: Ultimate Edition still plays well from a design perspective, but numerous technical issues hold the PC version back.;Gears of War: Ultimate Edition made Mike want to play the next two games in the Gears of War trilogy.
Project X Zone 2 Review;5;Mediocre; Project X Zone 2 embraces its extensive cast of characters, but it often falls into exhaustion due to its nonsensical plot and overreliance on its combat system.;Matt spent about 64 hours playing Project X Zone 2. His favorite Pair Unit to use was Strider Hiryu and Hotsuma, a ninja dream team that would've made his 4th grade self's mind explode.
Klaus Review;7;Good; Klaus is an unusual, post-modern platformer that reflects on what it means to be alive.;Dan Starkey's first game was Super Mario World. Since then he's loved taking occasional breaks from mind-melting strategy games to test his dexterity with platformers. GameSpot was provided a complimentary copy of the game for this review.
Heavy Rain Review;7;Good; David Cage‰Ûªs breakout title gets prettier, but not smarter.;This is Justin Clark‰Ûªs third playthrough of Heavy Rain, after two on PS3. Altogether, he has pressed X to Jason about 113 times, give or take. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game for this review.
Assassin's Creed Chronicles: Russia Review;5;Mediocre; Assassin's Creed Chronicles comes to a dull end in Russia.;Justin Clark finished AC Chronicles: Russia in about 6 hours. Ubisoft provided a copy of the game for this review.
Hitman Episode One Review;7;Good; The first episode of Hitman has a lot to offer creative assassins, but enjoying it requires you to look past an array of inconsistencies.;Peter completed each mission multiple times, played a few custom contracts that other users submitted online, and did his best to push the limits of Hitman's stealth engine over the course of 10 hours. Square Enix provided GameSpot with a complimentary copy of Hitman for this review.
Street Fighter 5 Review;7;Good; Street Fighter 5 is missing essential elements, but its fighting engine is one of the best around.;Peter has played Street Fighter daily for the past two weeks. Most of his time was spent playing the PS4 version of the game, but he also spent a few hours playing the PC version. Capcom provided GameSpot with a copy of the game for this review.
Fire Emblem Fates: Birthright Review;8;Great; Fire Emblem Fates: Birthright polishes the series' time-tested strategy combat and adds intimate, exciting interpersonal relationships.;Alexa Ray Corriea completed the main campaign of Birthright on both Casual and Classic modes, and spent many long hours breeding her army of child super soldiers.
The Walking Dead: Michonne - Episode 1: In Too Deep Review;6;Fair; One of The Walking Dead‰Ûªs most mysterious characters has a story to tell, though it‰Ûªs similar to one we‰Ûªve heard before.;Justin Clark played through In Too Deep twice--once on PC, once on Xbox One--with varying levels of surliness in his choices. Never forget, kids: Blades don‰Ûªt need reloading. Telltale Games provided GameSpot with a copy of the game for this review.
Fire Emblem Fates: Revelation Review;9;Superb; Fire Emblem Fates' neutral path delivers the biggest payoff of its three storylines, and is an incredible accomplishment in marriage of storytelling and gameplay.;Alexa Ray Corriea made it halfway through Revelation on Classic mode before switching to Casual to complete it. She got teary a few times. Nintendo provided GameSpot with copies of the game for this review.
Fire Emblem Fates: Conquest Review;7;Good; Fire Emblem Fates: Conquest is a punishing strategy RPG that marches forward and never looks back.;Peter Brown completed most of his journey through Conquest on Classic mode, before dropping down to Casual when the body count climbed and he realized he wanted more time with his steamy love interest, Niles. Nintendo provided GameSpot with copies of the game for this review.
Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 Review;7;Good; Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 is a great-looking, fast-paced anime fighting game that remains true to its roots for better and for worse.;Heidi went through all of story and adventure mode, and spent far too much time playing ninja dress-up for free battles. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of the game for this review.
Layers of Fear Review;7;Good; Colouring your world with intense shades of terror.;Matt took four hours to play through Layers of Fear in the dark, on a midrange laptop with decent headphones. The latter are for sale to raise money toward new trousers.
Superhot Review;8;Great; Superhot is a clever blend of shooter and puzzle elements that's driven by a devious, dark narrative.;Before writing his review, Peter spent the better part of a day completing every story level and a handful of challenge levels. GameSpot was provided with a complimentary copy of Superhot for this review.
Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare 2 Review;7;Good; A more complete, more refined version of the already stellar original, though arduous progression and empty solo missions spoil some of the fun.;Scott spent 18 hours gardening on Xbox One and PS4. Both copies were provided by publisher EA. He also participated in online multiplayer events organized by EA but hosted on the game's public servers.
Pillars of Eternity: The White March Part 2 Review;5;Mediocre; The White March Part II wraps up the Pillars of Eternity saga with heavy combat and a one-note mythological quest.;Brett spent around 12 hours trudging through the snowy wastes of the White March.
Arslan: The Warrior of Legend Review;7;Good; Omega Force‰Ûªs latest Warriors anime spin-off adapts an unlikely show that proves to be a surprisingly suitable fit.;Miguel beat Arslan's campaign and spent three hours on the other modes. He approached Arslan: The Warriors of Legend as a fan of the anime.
Blade & Soul Review;6;Fair; Blade & Soul's phenomenal combat isn't enough to make up for its dated quests.;Leif Johnson writes about video games on a remote ranch near the Texas coast. For the purposes of this review, he played Blade & Soul for around 60 hours.
Hard West Review;7;Good; Hard West is a satisfyingly creepy mash-up of six-gun horror and tactical combat.;Brett looked all over the place for Jonah Hex, but didn‰Ûªt find him in the 20 or so hours he spent out on the frightening frontier of Hard West.
The Deadly Tower of Monsters Review;6;Fair; The Deadly Tower of Monsters contains countless odes to the golden age of sci-fi B-movies, but its gameplay is rote to the core.;Don loves a good cheesy sci-fi movie as much as the next person. You can catch him quoting Galaxy Quest at inopportune moments. He spent five hours on The Deadly Tower of Monsters' campaign
The Mean Greens - Plastic Warfare Review;4;Poor; Great level design can't save this boring multiplayer shooter.;Mat likes online multiplayer shooters, and he put The Mean Greens - Plastic Warfare to the test for 12 hours. He's now worried he's being followed by sinister tan army men he can't see because they're blending in with the environment.
Dying Light: The Following Review;8;Great; Dying Light's latest DLC supplements the full game's first-person parkour with customizable dirt buggies, drastically different environments, and a conspiracy-driven mystery.;Scott sunk 12 hours into The Following but can't wait to go back and race his friends through fields of the undead. Turns out zombies and racing actually work well together.
Lego Marvel's Avengers Review;7;Good; Lego Marvel's Avengers is a familiar ride through some well-worn Lego territory, but it's a charming and fun one nonetheless.;Randolph played through the entire main campaign, several side missions, and spent a few hours in the open world of New York to try and unlock as many characters as he could. Finding Squirrel Girl made him very, very happy.
Devilian Review;6;Fair; Devilian doesn't ask for much, and delivers just enough to pass the time.;Janine Hawkins has tried out dozens of free-to-play MMOs over the years, and in spite of a few bad apples she's managed to retain the will to try just about anything at least once. She put two weeks into Devilian for the purposes of this review, reaching the current level cap and exploring the cash shop with one character while testing the limits of a cash-free Devilian experience with another. Trion Worlds provided GameSpot with a copy of the game and access to patron-specific items.
The Witness Review;9;Superb; In both structure and detail, The Witness is an original, difficult, and ultimately rewarding puzzle game.;Mike Mahardy spent more than 30 hours trying to complete as many of The Witness' panels as he could. Many of them were too hard.
Firewatch Review;7;Good; Though its plot doesn't fully pay off, Firewatch gives you a thorough, thoughtful insight into the formation of a meaningful relationship.;Scott savored his first Firewatch play-through, completing the game in just over seven hours. He's since burned through again in just under five.
SteamWorld Heist Review;8;Great; Tense combat, complex mechanics, and witty dialogue make this 2D turn-based strategy game an unexpected but worthwhile successor to 2013's SteamWorld Dig.;Matt spent 15 hours playing SteamWorld Heist during his first time through. and now he's more than willing to put in more hours to max out the level of his in-game crew.
Minecraft Story Mode--Episode 4: A Block and a Hard Place Review;7;Good; Despite some emotional beats not hitting as hard as they should, Episode 4 of Minecraft Story Mode feels like a satisfying ending (even though there's more to come).;Randolph Ramsay played through this latest Minecraft episode twice. The next playthrough will be with his six-year-old son.
Unravel Review;7;Good; Achingly beautiful, often inspired, but does it play as wonderful as it looks?;Rob played the first two levels of Unravel at a review event hosted by EA and the remainder at home on his PS4. Altogether he spent more than eight hours playing.
Final Fantasy Explorers Review;7;Good; Final Fantasy Explorers is a mashup of fanservice and Monster Hunter-like quests packed with deep character customization and genuinely fun multiplayer.;Alexa Ray Corriea spent entirely too much time with Final Fantasy Explorers already, and wrote her review after cresting level 80 (Pablo the Chocobo was level 61).
Darkest Dungeon Review;9;Superb; A richly satisfying and wonderfully executed masterpiece.;Daniel Starkey loves roguelikes and eldritch horror. He lost 49 adventurers over the course of 29 hours in Darkest Dungeon.
King's Quest Chapter 2: Rubble Without a Cause Review;5;Mediocre; The revived King‰Ûªs Quest takes a step back in Rubble Without a Cause, the oddly depressing second chapter in this modern take on the legendary Sierra adventures from the 1980s.;Brett spent nearly four hours trying to feed King Graham and his fairy tale pals in Daventry.
Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak Review;9;Superb; Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak is a prequel to the famed Homeworld Strategy series. It follows its inspirations closely, but adds its own touches to create something new and wonderful.;Daniel spent 10 hours playing Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak's campaign, and another 15 hours in multiplayer and skirmish matches.
Gravity Rush Remastered Review;7;Good; Gravity Rush's acrobatic heroine and fairytale metropolis feel at home in the PS4 remaster of the 2012 Vita hit.;Peter played through Gravity Rush's story missions, deviated to explore the world and side quests, and played around for the joy of manipulating gravity, in twelve hours. Sony Computer Entertainment provided GameSpot with a complimentary copy of the game.
This War of Mine: The Little Ones Review;7;Good; The war comes to consoles, but might have lost something along the way.;Justin Clark played through three scenarios of This War of Mine. He‰Ûªs still yet to get a group to survive a full run. He‰Ûªs already resigned to probably being the person other survivors kill and eat first when the real collapse comes.
Bombshell Review;2;Terrible; Bombshell is a disastrous mix of monotonous gameplay, annoying bugs, and atrocious writing.;Kevin VanOrd used to be Senior Editor at GameSpot before he embarked on a video game design career. Now he‰Ûªs between projects, so expect to see his byline from time to time. Kevin played 12 hours of Bombshell before a game-ending bug stopped him in his tracks.
Dirt Rally Review;8;Great; The Dark Souls of driving games. Dirt Rally celebrates the unbridled purity of this brutal motorsport.;Richard spent over 18 hours in the muddy tundra of Dirt Rally. He‰Ûªs now marginally above average in some of the cars.
Tharsis Review;6;Fair; Tharsis is a captivating but sadistic game of chance that puts your fate at the mercy of dice.;So far, Edmond Tran has played over 10 hours of Tharsis and only made it to Mars a couple of times. He loves space and hates gambling.
Mario & Luigi: Paper Jam Review;6;Fair; Worlds collide in this risk-averse Mario RPG.;Miguel needed 32 hours to play through and clear Mario & Luigi: Paper Jam. He has also beaten two other Mario & Luigi games as well as two Paper Mario games.
Rainbow Six Siege Review;8;Great; With its destructible environments, diverse Operators, and distinctive attackers-vs-defenders setup, Ubisoft's multiplayer-focused shooter offers something rare among modern FPS games: tactical depth.;Scott spent nearly 18 hours Sieging on PS4, though he also tested the PC and Xbox versions with the help of several GameSpot colleagues. They can all confirm that Siege is better with friends.
Beyond: Two Souls Review;8;Great; David Cage‰Ûªs best ‰ÛÏinteractive drama‰Û experiment to date comes to PS4 in better shape than ever.;Justin Clark played through the new version of Beyond to completion, which would be his third go-around with the game altogether. For all his efforts, he could not find a way to slip the phrase ‰ÛÏPress X to Jodie‰Û into this review. And for this, he is sorry.
Amplitude Review;7;Good; The rhythm game that put Harmonix on the map returns with spot-on mechanics and a brand new setlist that can't quite compete with the original.;Scott Butterworth spent a solid 12 hours cruising down Amplitude's trippy highways. He also roped in some coworkers for couch-based competitive multiplayer.
Fat Princess Adventures Review;5;Mediocre; Fat Princess Adventures' charm and humor fail to elevate it above its mediocre premise.;Mat played Fat Princess Adventures to completion and played a few rounds of the Grindhouse mode. He was going to put way more food puns in this review, but he didn't want to sound too cheesy.
Assassin‰Ûªs Creed Chronicles: India Review;7;Good; The middle chapter of the Chronicles trilogy improves the formula, but doesn‰Ûªt perfect it.;"Justin Clark was able to slip in and out of AC Chronicles: India in about five and a half hours, compared to three and a half or so for China. Far too much of that time was spent remembering the Monty Python ""How To Not Be Seen"" skit at the worst possible moment, snickering, and Arbaaz catching a face full of lead as a result."
Oxenfree Review;8;Great; Masterful audiovisual design and a witty script set Oxenfree's tale of angsty teens battling the supernatural apart from other horror games.;Alexa Ray Corriea is a sucker for ghost hunts and replayed Oxenfree five times to explore possible choices and endings.
Resident Evil 0: HD Remaster Review;7;Good; Resident Evil Zero HD makes an already good survival-horror game better with upgraded visuals, modern controls, and an exciting new way to play.;Peter beat Resident Evil 0: HD Remaster on normal difficulty and played Wesker mode for two hours before writing his review. Capcom provided GameSpot with a complimentary copy of the game.
That Dragon Cancer Review;9;Superb; Heartbreaking, painful, and important.;Justin Clark was able to finish That Dragon Cancer in about two hours. He WAS going to make pancakes for breakfast the next morning. Those plans have changed.
Anno 2205 Review;5;Mediocre; Anno 2205 wears a distant future sci-fi aesthetic, but does nothing of substance or import with the premise.;Daniel Starkey's been a fan of city-builders since he picked up a copy of SimCity 3000 at the ripe age of 10. Since then he's wanted to recapture the magic he first felt when he broke ground on his first fusion reactor.
Star Wars Battlefront Review;7;Good; Star Wars Battlefront brings grand spectacle to the iconic sci-fi universe, but the overall experience wears thin with time.;Mike Mahardy spent 10 hours with Battlefront at a review event on PS4, and 15 hours more with a retail Xbox One copy that he played online through EA Access. He plans on testing the PS4 retail servers following launch.
Bloodborne: The Old Hunters Review;9;Superb; The presumptive first and last expansion to one of the best games of 2015 is worth every death, every item discovery, and every visceral attack.;Miguel‰Ûªs prior work on Bloodborne walkthrough for Gamespot gave him more than enough preparation for The Old Hunters. What resulted was an eight-hour playthrough through all of this expansion‰Ûªs locales and an additional hour using the new gear in the main game.
Mario Tennis: Ultra Smash Review;6;Fair; After more than a decade of handheld titles and digital re-releases, Mario Tennis finally returns to consoles with Mega Mushrooms, online multiplayer, and a disappointing lack of content.;Scott once broke a Nintendo 64 controller while playing Mario Tennis. It was not his controller. Thankfully, all controllers survived his 16 hours with Ultra Smash.
Game of Thrones: Episode Six ‰ÛÓ The Ice Dragon Review;8;Great; Game of Thrones' finale includes surprising twists, gut-wrenching decisions, and myriad branching paths, encouraging you to return to Westeros one more time.;Alexa Ray Corriea played through The Ice Dragon four times, twice using each different world state from the end of the previous episode. In total she spent around 8 hours with this episode making various choices.
Yakuza 5 Review;8;Great; One of the last exclusives on the PlayStation 3 tops off the console‰Ûªs software library on a high note with brawling gangsters and idol singers.;Miguel played Yakuza 5 for 45 hours before writing his review. He beat the main storylines, almost all the optional content, and achieved some degree of success in all the minigames. While not fluent in Japanese, Miguel imported and beat the original Yakuza (Ryu Ga Gotoku) long before its U.S. localisation was official, and has beat every other game in the series, including Dead souls. Sega provided a Miguel with an advanced copy of the game for his review.
Skyshine's Bedlam Review;6;Fair; Shallow strategy and the lack of meaningful progression overshadow moments of amusement in this post-apocalyptic roguelike.;Mat is a big fan of Mad Max and thinks puking lizards are pretty hilarious. He played 15 hours of Skyshine‰Ûªs Bedlam for this review.
Xenoblade Chronicles X Review;8;Great; Xenoblade Chronicles X is an ambitious game that succeeds on many fronts, but tapping into its greatness requires patience and perseverance.;Peter spent 65 hours in Xenoblade Chronicles X and still longs to uncover all of its secrets, but more importantly, all of its Skells. Nintendo provided a copy of the game for the purpose of this review.
Minecraft: Story Mode Episode Three--The Last Place You Look Review;8;Great; The best episode in Minecraft Story Mode so far will make your fears about creepy Endermen flare up all over again.;Randolph played through Episode Three on both the Xbox One and PC. One playthrough was with his six-year-old son.
The Crew: Wild Run Edition Review;6;Fair;" The Wild Run expansion improves Ubisoft's lackluster ""carPG"" The Crew in a number of ways but can't quite redeem the entire experience.";Scott spent roughly 14 hours getting reacquainted with The Crew and its giant, unwieldy world map. He wishes he could have spent all that time in the monster truck arena.
Starcraft 2: Legacy of the Void Review;8;Great; Starcraft II: Legacy of the Void is an excellent follow-up to 2013's Heart of The Swarm, even if it doesn't quite match the brilliance of Wings of Liberty.;Daniel Starkey's been a rabid Starcraft fan since one fateful LAN party back in 2000. He traded an old audio card for a copy of the game and its expansion, and has since purchased the game five more times just to satisfy cravings. He spent 50 hours over a week running through the campaign, training against AI, and then breaking into ranked matches for the purposes of this review.
Just Cause 3 Review;8;Great; Just Cause 3 is a stunning display of cause and effect, despite weak story missions and occasional technical problems.;Mike Mahardy spent 30 total hours with Just Cause 3 across every platform. He blew up a lot of stuff.
Sword Coast Legends Review;6;Fair; Sword Coast Legends promised a true multiplayer RPG. If it doesn‰Ûªt live up to that, does it still have something to offer?;Dan Griliopoulos has been playing Dungeons & Dragons video games since he was machine spirit-high to a modron. He played Sword Coast Legends over the course of a week.
Yo-Kai Watch Review;7;Good; Yo-Kai Watch is a quirky tale with deeply strategic combat, but the way you collect its creatures leaves too much up to random chance.;Alexa Ray Corriea was once a part-time paranormal investigator for extra cash. She completed Yo-Kai Watch's main story and most of its side quests, clocking in around 35 hours with the game.
Downwell Review;8;Great; Challenging, accessible and engaging. Downwell is a focused action-platformer done well.;Edmond Tran has spent over seven hours with Downwell on PC, and countless more on iOS. He recommends you play Downwell with a DualShock 4 and vertical monitor setup.
Fallout 4 Review;9;Superb; Fallout 4 rewards your curiosity with excellent storytelling and hearty doses of tense combat in a wasteland full of possibilities.;Peter completed the main storyline and dozens of side quests with over 40 hours under his belt. He played the game primarily on PlayStation 4, but also spent a couple of hours testing the Xbox One and PC versions of the game. Bethesda provided GameSpot with a promotional copy of the game for all three platforms.
Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 Review;7;Good; Black Ops III presents fine-tuned multiplayer, engaging fights against the undead, and a boring campaign.;Mike Mahardy still remembers how good the first Black Ops was. He hopes someone can bottle that lightning again.
Read Only Memories Review;8;Great; Read Only Memories is an eye-catching, cyberpunk-themed adventure that cleverly presents and explores important societal issues.;Daniel Starkey spent 10 hours digging through the mysterious disappearance of a legendary computer programmer with the help of a delightful, snarky robot.
Warhammer: End Times -- Vermintide Review;7;Good; Left 4 Dead's frantic four-player co-op gets medieval with melee combat, mutant rats, and mixed results.;Scott was lucky enough to stumble across several helpful strangers while battling through 15 hours of Vermintide--and that means a lot in a team-based game.
WWE 2K16 Review;4;Poor; Devoid of the character and personality that makes wrestling fun, WWE 2K16 continues to fail to deliver the spectacle of pro wrestling while further muddling the game's core mechanical experience.;Don Saas wants nothing more than a wrestling game that feels as exciting as the Sasha Banks/Bayley Iron Woman match at NXT: Takeover, but WWE 2K16 is far from that mark. He spent over 22 hours with the game for review.
Life is Strange Episode Five Review;6;Fair; The finale of Life is Strange undermines its powerful, heartfelt story and cracks its tense atmosphere with tedious gamey sequences and a disappointing climax.;Alexa Ray Corriea rewound until she couldn't rewind anymore, exploring all possible outcomes for Life is Strange.
Mushroom 11 Review;6;Fair; This inventive and arresting puzzle game depicts the ruins of a world far beyond armageddon.;Rob played Mushroom 11 for about ten hours on both a home PC and Macbook Pro. The save file doesn't transfer over -_-
The Legend of Zelda: Tri Force Heroes Review;5;Mediocre; The newest installment in the storied franchise tries a lot of new things, but accomplishes only a few.;Mike Mahardy has played every Zelda game, and cares about the chronological order of the series.
Football Manager 2016 Review;7;Good; Football Manager 2016 enjoys a few smart incremental updates, as well as a new take on Classic Mode that trims some of the series' more laborious features.;Tom has spent thousands of hours playing a dozen different iterations of Football Manager over the course of fifteen years, including the ones where matches were just text.
The Legend of Legacy Review;6;Fair; The Legend of Legacy offers a role-playing campaign without the training wheels.;If you count all of the progress he lost to horrible deaths along the way, Jason Venter spent most of 50 hours exploring the hostile island of Avalon. For the purposes of this review, he cleared the game with Garnet and friends and then started through it a second time with Eloise.
Assassin's Creed Syndicate Review;9;Superb; Syndicate is a return to form for the Assassin's Creed franchise, delivering a unique, engaging story in a world that feels alive.;Alexa Ray Corriea has made it a point to never miss an Assassin's Creed game. She finished the main campaign of Syndicate along with enough side operations to net 75 percent synchronization for this review.
Armikrog Review;5;Mediocre; Armikrog is a lackluster adventure that never manages to capitalize on the charm of its unique visuals and premise.;Matt Espineli loves point-and-click adventures and enjoyed playing with Play-Doh as a child. He always found The Neverhood charming and was hoping to feel the same about Armikrog.
Halo 5: Guardians Review;8;Great; 343 Industries introduces a new multiplayer mode to great effect, but its campaign story holds the overall experience back.;Mike Mahardy's favorite Halo is Halo 2. His favorite mission is Truth and Reconciliation from Combat Evolved. His favorite weapon is the Covenant Carbine.
Guitar Hero Live Review;6;Fair; Embarrassing acting, questionable songs choices, and unwelcome microtransactions spoil the biggest mechanical improvement to music gaming in years.;Scott endured some music he truly hates during his many, many hours in Guitar Hero Live. But he also got to play some classic Weezer, so it's cool.
Tales of Zestiria Review;6;Fair; The first Tales game on the PlayStation 4 hits the series‰Ûª familiar notes while proving that it‰Ûªs better to be raised by angels than by wolves.;It took Miguel 65 hours to beat Tales of Zestiria which included time spent with the game‰Ûªs optional content. He beat six Tales games prior to this review. If you described a Tales plot in one sentence, he might be able to tell you the name of that Tales games.
NBA Live 16 Review;5;Mediocre; NBA Live 16 takes incremental steps forward in ball control and online functionality, but its underdeveloped modes and inconsistent mechanics make it a chore to play.;For the purposes of this review, Josiah Renaudin played through two seasons of Rising Star, won a championship as a GM in Dynasty, and built an all-star team in Ultimate Team.
Need For Speed Review;8;Great; Need For Speed borrows from the series' past to create an excellent street racer with a handful of obnoxious but ultimately forgivable problems.;Scott Butterworth needs lots of things. Speed is one of them. But he also needed around 25 hours to fully upgrade his Lamborghini Aventador.
The Park Review;7;Good; The Park is filled with very creepy moments but relies too much on a story which suffers from disjointed pacing.;A seasoned horror game veteran, Zorine finished The Park twice for this review. Her first playthrough took two hours and she was thrilled each time she found a reference to The Secret World.
Minecraft: Story Mode Episode Two -- Assembly Required Review;8;Great; Episode Two is a fast-paced affair that once again proves to be a charming, winning adventure for both fans and newbies to the world of Minecraft.;Randolph completed Episode Two twice to see both the Magnus and Ellegaard stories.
Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth - Rising Tide Review;9;Superb; Firaxis introduces naval colonization and an expansive new diplomacy system to the futuristic 4X game.;Mike Mahardy spent 24 hours with Rising Tide, and still hates siege worms.
Prison Architect Review;7;Good; Tonally uneven, yet still one of the more fascinating game experiences ever made.;Justin Clark spent about 12 hours with Prison Architect. He has not been able to get System of a Down‰Ûªs Prison Song out of his head all 12 of those hours.
Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer Review;5;Mediocre; Despite revamped controls and a cheerful aesthetic, Happy Home Designer still feels like a dead-end job.;Justin spent over 20 hours in Happy Home Designer, and he's a little embarrassed to admit he has spent over 400 hours in its predecessor Animal Crossing: New Leaf.
Grand Ages: Medieval Review;5;Mediocre; Grand Ages: Medieval encourages you to conquer by controlling trade routes and strong-arming the economy instead resorting to military force.;Daniel Starkey has conquered Europe a thousand times in a thousand ways. For the purposes of this review, he spent 65 hours fiddling with trade routes and hoarding gold.
Chibi-Robo Zip Lash Review;4;Poor; Chibi-Robo Zip Lash has charming moments, but it's a mostly-bland adventure defined by disappointing design choices.;Peter traveled the globe with Chibi-Robo in about ten hours, doing his best to delivery candy to sugar-crazed characters.
Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water Review;5;Mediocre; Fatal Frame's debut on the Wii U builds a chilling, believable atmosphere but mars it with clunky controls and a forgettable story devoid of real drama.;As someone who was a part time paranormal investigator to earn extra money during college, Alexa Ray Corriea is well acquainted with the Fatal Frame franchise. She played Maiden of Black Water to completion for this review and spent some extra time just snapping ghosty pics.
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Hearts of Stone Review;9;Superb; CD Projekt Red's first paid expansion is well worth the return to the Northern Kingdoms.;Mike wishes he could talk about Hearts of Stone's plot points here, but doesn't want to spoil them for you. Let him know when you beat it.
Transformers: Devastation Review;7;Good; The war between the Autobots and Decepticons receives a superficial yet satisfying new chapter.;Scott Butterworth was born in the '80s, so he loves Transformers by default.
Tales from the Borderlands: Episode Five ‰ÛÓ The Vault of the Traveler Review;9;Superb; Tales from the Borderlands' finale wraps up a masterful story in an equally masterful package, ending its poignant and witty story on a high note.;Alexa Ray Corriea played every conceivable outcome for Tales from the Borderlands' finale.
Runbow Review;7;Good; Runbow may lack some bite, but its nine-player races make for a wild, chaotic party game and an incredibly varied platformer.;Jeremy Signor loves a good platformer, with some of his recent favorites being 1001 Spikes and Electronic Super Joy. After six hours, he can add Runbow to that list.
Elite: Dangerous Review;7;Good; Although slow and complicated at times, Elite: Dangerous nevertheless provides a rewarding open-world experience on Xbox One.;Leif Johnson grew up practically next door to NASA in the Houston area, where he gained an early love of space exploration games. For the purposes of this review, he played Elite: Dangerous for approximately 20 hours.
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5 Review;3;Bad; Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5 is riddled with glitches and offers almost nothing new to longtime fans of the series.;Peter played 10 hours of THPS5 before he was unable to cope with the boring challenges, constant loading screens, and relentless glitches.
Afro Samurai 2: Revenge of Kuma Volume One Review;2;Terrible; Afro Samurai 2: Revenge of Kuma is an irredeemable mess.;Peter endured Revenge of Kuma Volume One for two hours, completing the game and unlocking every ability.
Cities: Skylines After Dark Review;8;Great; City life after the sun goes down is the focus of After Dark, an expansion for Cities: Skylines that adds nightlife and other new features to the reigning champion of ...;Another dozen hours in the virtual municipalities of Cities: Skylines just flew by for Brett, who can always find the time to hang out in the late-night bars of After Dark.
Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection Review;8;Great; The remastered collection brings us back to the treasure hunter's roots, and prepares us for his next adventure.;Mike Mahardy still enjoys Uncharted 3 more than any other in the series, despite that arduous desert scene.
NBA 2K16 Review;8;Great; NBA 2K16 injects the series with powerful new mechanics, but without proper guidance, it leaves training up to you.;For the purposes of this review, Josiah played through a few seasons in MyCareer, brought a championship home in MyGM, and spent hours in each of the additional game modes.
The Beginner's Guide Review;8;Great; The Beginner‰Ûªs Guide is a fascinating journey into the thoughts and processes involved in the creation of a video game, and the people that make them.;Edmond Tran spent two hours completing The Beginner‰Ûªs Guide, but he's still thinking about what it all means.
Rock Band 4 Review;7;Good; Rock Band 4 attempts to revitalize the music/rhythm genre with a slightly updated take on its classic hard-rocking, note-matching gameplay.;Scott Butterworth is a lifelong musician and a shameless karaoke fiend. He's been rocking out on plastic instruments ever since the original Guitar Hero.
Minecraft: Story Mode Episode One--The Order of the Stone Review;7;Good; It's a slow start, but a pleasant one, for Telltale's narrative take on one of the world's most popular games.;Randolph played through Episode One twice, making different choices to see how the narrative would be affected. Game reviewed using a PC version supplied by the developer.
FIFA 16 Review;9;Superb; The biggest gameplay changes in years leave FIFA feeling fresh for the new season.;Nathan played FIFA 16 offline and online on PlayStation 4 and on Xbox One, where he got George Best in Draft mode and didn‰Ûªt want to say goodbye.
Dragon Quest Heroes: The World Tree's Woe and the Blight Below Review;8;Great; The slime army awaits, wide-eyed and smiling as worlds collide in this inspired Dragon Quest spin-off.;It took Miguel 40 hours to handily beat Dragon Quest Heroes with over 100 side quests completed. He comes into Dragon Quest Heroes having beaten five mainline Dragon Quests, his favorite being Dragon Quest VIII.
Skylanders SuperChargers Review;8;Great; Now in its fifth iteration, the Skylanders series continues to provide some of the best kid-friendly gaming available.;Randolph completed the game solo on the PS4 version, and is about halfway through the Wii U version with his son. All toys and starter packs were provided by Activision.
Blood Bowl 2 Review;8;Great; Brutality and turn-based gameplay make an unlikely combination in this sports management game.;Dan has been playing Blood Bowl as a board game since the early 90s, and put too many hours into the previous Blood Bowl game
LEGO Dimensions Review;8;Great; LEGO Dimensions' franchise mash-ups provide many wonderful moments, and it works equally well as a toy and a game.;Playing LEGO Dimensions made Randolph realise he needs to work on his fine motor skills. He completed the main campaign using mostly the characters and vehicle in the starter pack, but did open a Chima and Scooby Doo pack at the insistence of his six-year-old son. All sets and toys provided by Warner Bros Interactive Entertainment.
Dropsy Review;7;Good; Dropsy is a genuine and somber adventure about a creepy clown that exceeds its quirky premise in the most meaningful way.;Dropsy brought many warm feelings to Matt Espineli's heart. He doesn't have a fear of clowns, but imagines that the game would be a completely different experience for someone who does.
Act of Aggression Review;7;Good; Act of Aggression is set in a near-future sci-fi world where three factions vie for control of the Earth.;Daniel Starkey is a strategy game obsessive, always on the hunt for the perfect test of mental acuity. For the purposes of this review, he played a dozen multiplayer matches and finished the campaign over the course of 20 hours.
SOMA Review;9;Superb; It may not stir the hordes of wailing YouTubers looking for the next best haunted house, but SOMA succeeds at crafting something much more meaningful than jump-scares.;Richard spent 10 hours in SOMA's murky depths, preferably with the lights off and a pair of headphones on.
PES 2016 Review;9;Superb; Konami's dethroned soccer series has entered a new golden age.;Rob played PES 2016 on PlayStation 4 throughout a full week prior to review. The servers were inaccessible during this period.
Destiny: The Taken King Review;8;Great; Bungie's newest expansion not only offers a compelling experience in itself, but transforms Destiny altogether.;Mike's hunter reached level 40 within 15 minutes of starting The Taken King. 35 hours later, he's now at Light level 296.
Persona 4: Dancing All Night Review;5;Mediocre; The combination of a flawed rhythm game and a disappointing narrative make Persona 4 Dancing All Night an underwhelming experience.;Heidi is still angry nobody put the funky dorm music from Persona 3 in this game. Or the Persona 3 boss music. Or anything Persona 3, really.
NHL 16 Review;8;Great; NHL 16 fixes the mistakes of its predecessor, bringing the NHL franchise back to form.;Mat is Canadian, so he‰Ûªs basically required by law to love hockey. He‰Ûªs also played every NHL game since 2001 and spent more than 30 hours with NHL 16. (Twitter: http://twitter.com/MatPaget)
Satellite Reign Review;6;Fair; Satellite Reign allows you to create the cyberpunk team of your fantasy, but the game's broken pathfinding and enemy AI are too easy to exploit.;Don digs the beat poetry inspired cyberpunk of William Gibson and the comic absurdity of Neal Stephenson as well as a great tactical strategy game. He spent just over 20 hours with Satellite Reign in order to finish his mission.
Forza Motorsport 6 Review;8;Great; Forza Motorsport 6 builds off of the series' bright past by introducing new features that make it more than just a pretty trip down memory lane.;Miguel has put at least 200 combined hours into the last three Forza games, including Forza Motorsport 6, where he spent over 30 hours in career mode and multiplayer races.
World of Warships Review;8;Great; World of Warships delivers thrilling naval combat and puts you in command of an impressive number of WWII-era ships.;Cameron Woolsey still has a tough time telling the difference between aft and stern, and also wants to know if a poop deck is what he thinks it is. For this review, Cameron played for around 40 hours, unlocking up to tier five of the Japanese vessels on his own, while experiencing aircraft carriers and high-tier ships on a Wargaming press account.
Sorcerer King Review;8;Great; Sorcerer King is a new 4X game from Stardock, producers of classics like Sins of a Solar Empire and Fallen Enchantress.;Dan Starkey is a 4X fanatic, always looking novel takes on one of gaming's oldest genres. He spent over 50 hours mixing it up with the dreaded Sorcerer King for this review.
Dishonored: Definitive Edition Review;8;Great; A better version of a great game, but not as definitive as it could be.;This would be Justin Clark‰Ûªs third playthrough of Dishonored, though only the first time playing through the DLC. He will be the first to tell you he only killed the Broadcaster in the name of Carrie Fisher. He regrets nothing.
Super Mario Maker Review;9;Superb; The ultimate 2D Mario experience puts the creative reigns in your hands with a simple and satisfying level-building experience.;The version of the game Nintendo provided for review exists on a separate server that will be cleared out once the game's actual servers go live. However, you can find examples of the stages we created, and some gameplay highlights, in our PAX Prime 2015 Mario Maker challenge video.
Pillars of Eternity: The White March Part 1 Review;6;Fair; The White March Part 1 is a testing and slightly predictable expansion for Pillars of Eternity.;The frosty setting of The White March made Brett realize what he has to look forward to in just a few months up in Eastern Ontario. All Canada needs to do is add some dwarves.
Shadowrun: Hong Kong Review;8;Great; Shadowrun takes a successful, though familiar trip to the Far East.;Most of Justin Clark‰Ûªs Shadowrun experience was on SNES and Genesis. Most of that time was spent getting shot to death by dudes with pink mohawks. He is glad to see things haven‰Ûªt changed much.
Disgaea 5: Alliance of Vengeance Review;8;Great; Disgaea 5 is bigger and more complex than any Disgaea game before it.;Jason Venter has spent dozens of hours with each previous Disgaea game except for the visual novel, and he happily spent around 50 hours on this campaign before devoting another 30 to the post-game content for the purposes of this review.
Tearaway Unfolded Review;8;Great; Tearaway Unfolded leverages the DualShock 4's unique inputs to recreate the charm and wonderment of the original Vita adventure.;Josiah Renaudin played and enjoyed the original Tearaway on the PlayStation Vita, and has a strong affinity for 3D platformers. For the purposes of this review, he reached the end of Unfolded‰Ûªs story while trying his hardest to avoid drawing anything vulgar.
Mega Man Legacy Collection Review;7;Good; Mega Man Legacy Collection is a fascinating peek into the 8-bit roots of one of gaming's most beloved franchises', but it can be unforgiving for a modern audience.;Don's first Mega Man game was Mega Man X on the SNES which he was not good enough to beat as a little kid. He spent just under 20 hours with this game for review.
Zombi Review;7;Good; This charming survival horror game is a Wii U exclusive no more, but can it compete on other platforms?;ZombiU was one of Britton Peele's favorite experiences from the Wii U's launch library. He enjoyed revisiting the undead adventure through a roughly 10 hour standard difficulty playthrough, which he managed to get through by killing only a handful of survivors.
Toy Soldiers: War Chest Review;5;Mediocre; Toy Soldiers: War Chest is a fun tower defense game marred by paywalls and glitches.;Cameron Woolsey was an avid collector of action figures (not toys!) back in his day. He oversaw incredible battles for supremacy between green anthropomorphic turtles and Bat-men hailing from both film and television. Most of them now are listed as missing in action, i.e., buried in a backyard somewhere. For the sake of this review, Cameron played more than 15 hours, completing the campaign and a handful of online matches.
Devil's Third Review;3;Bad; Devil's Third is entertaining in bursts, but its many frustrations far outweigh any of its positives.;Sean Bell has plenty in common with the hero of Devil's Third--he's going bald, and only a 12 year-old could ever think he's cool.
Mad Max Review;6;Fair; Mad Max offers great car combat and some gorgeous scenery, but with simplistic fighting mechanics and tedious activities, it quickly loses its luster.;Peter spent over 15 hours exploring the dangerous yet beautiful world of Mad Max for this review, completing the story mode and looking for cars to blow up just for the fun of it.
LBX: Little Battlers eXperience Review;7;Good; Despite some rather clunky design choices, Level-5's LBX: Little Battler‰Ûªs eXperience is an action-RPG that is complex and entertaining.;Matt‰Ûªs combined love for robots and hokey anime narrative tropes made his time with LBX: Little Battler‰Ûªs eXperience appropriately enjoyable.
Disney Infinity 3.0 Review;8;Great; This is the best Infinity's structured play sets have ever been, but the Toy Box remains a wonderful, awe-inspiring and simultaneously overwhelming experience.;Randolph completed Twilight of the Republic, played several more hours in the Toy Box Hub, and created a few levels using the new tools in Infinity. His six-year-old son Sebastian assisted, but was really confused as to why Olaf couldn't have Force powers, too.
Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls Review;7;Good; Though Ultra Despair Girls' action components stumble at points, the superb narrative and character development make the rest of the game a riveting experience.;Heidi spent a little over 18 hours in the wreckage of Towa City. She‰Ûªs quite tempted to go back and find all the files and scraps she missed on her first playthrough. How will the riveting storybook tale of Socki the ultra-kawaii sock end?
N++ Review;8;Great; The ninja returns, better than ever.;Justin Clark blew through the intro and made it through half the main stages before writing his review. He will neither confirm or deny the number of times he has caught himself humming Revenge of Shinobi music during gameplay.
Red Goddess: Inner World Review;3;Bad; Red Goddess is a frustrating, uninspired platformer that‰Ûªs neither fun nor fair.;Josiah Renaudin loves platformers of both the 2D and 3D variety, citing Super Mario World as the greatest game of all time. For the purpose of this review, he (begrudgingly) made his way through Red Goddess and defeated the final boss.
Tales from the Borderlands: Episode Four - Escape Plan Bravo Review;6;Fair; Tales from the Borderlands' penultimate episode stretches thin its gamey bits, but its emphasis on character relationships and humanity make it a heartbreaking experience.;Alexa Ray Corriea has far too many save files for Tales from the Borderlands because she wants to experience everything and it's driving her absolutely nuts.
Volume Review;8;Great; Volume's tight mechanics, smart visual vocabulary, and level-editing tools combine to create something that is as much a puzzle game as it is a stealth title.;Mike Mahardy spent about 10 hours playing Volume's campaign, and later found at least 50 user-created maps that were far better than his.
The Bridge Review;7;Good; Years after its initial release, The Bridge is still a great example of 2D puzzle gaming.;From Myst to Braid to the sides of cereal boxes, Britton Peele enjoys having a good puzzle to solve. After finishing all eight chapters of The Bridge he sought the Internet's help in getting every single one of the game's achievements ...mostly so his Gamerscore would be divisible by five again.
Everybody's Gone to the Rapture Review;9;Superb; The studio behind Dear Esther and Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs have achieved audiovisual and narrative excellence with their latest adventure.;Alexa Ray Corriea explored every square inch of Everybody's Gone to the Rapture's world to exhaustion.
The Talos Principle: Road To Gehenna Review;7;Good; Though the puzzles this time prove vestigial, Road To Gehenna delivers the same smart environmental puzzles and thoughtful commentary on humanity as its predecessor.;Jeremy Signor considered The Talos Principle one of his favorite games of 2014 and, after fifteen hours with Road To Gehenna, is slightly disappointed it doesn't quite reach the same heights.
Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain Review;10;Essential; Kojima's open-world opus succeeds in delivering incredible gameplay and captivating storytelling.;Peter has played every Metal Gear game there is, and spent almost 50 hours with The Phantom Pain for this review. His total completion percentage, after beating the main storyline and playing a few dozen side ops, amounted to 40 percent. He played the game for one day at a review event at Konami's Los Angeles headquarters, but completed it at home using a copy of the game provided by Konami. For the review event, Konami paid for travel and other accommodations.
Cabal 2 Review;4;Poor; If you've played a free-to-play MMOG in the past 5 years, then you've played Cabal 2.;Janine Hawkins went through a few years of deep dives into F2P MMOG after F2P MMOG, from Shaiya to Vindictus to the original Cabal. That said, her time with Cabal 2 has not made her reflect fondly on that period of her life.
Dragon Age: Inquisition - The Descent Review;6;Fair; Hacking and slashing are the highlights of a so-so expedition to the Deep Roads in the Descent DLC for Dragon Age: Inquisition;Spending seven or eight hours underground in The Descent made Brett realize that he might be claustrophobic after all.
Until Dawn Review;8;Great; Until Dawn is a thoughtful game that exploits its tropes and sets up a system of mechanics and branching narrative that make for a chilling, irresistible experience.;Alexa Ray Corriea played Until Dawn religiously for about a week, and has completed four total playthroughs with some dabbling in rewinding to specific chapters. She still hasn't' seen everything.
Gears of War: Ultimate Edition Review;7;Good; The Coalition has crafted a faithful homage to a nine-year-old game, but hasn't completely erased the blemishes of the past, especially on PC.;Mike Mahardy still remembers the first time he chainsawed his friend, and Gears of War: Ultimate Edition helped him relive that moment.
Madden NFL 16 Review;8;Great; EA‰Ûªs juggernaut sports series delivers its 2015 installment with finesse and prowess, making it worth the attention of both fans and newcomers.;Miguel‰Ûªs review was based off approximately 15 hours of play time spread across all of Madden NFL 16‰Ûªs modes including a thorough dive into the Gatorade Skills Trainer. He completed a season run using the Eagles in Franchise mode even though he has no emotional or residential ties to the team. As a San Francisco resident, Miguel is baffled at the 49ers‰Ûª recent implosion. He also enjoys rewatching the Butler play about once a week.
Rare Replay Review;8;Great; Rare Replay is a massive collection of great games and interesting documentaries, but not everything is as good as it could have been.;Peter played a little bit of every game in Rare Replay, but spent the most time playing Battletoads, R.C. Pro Am, Conker's Bad Fur Day, and Banjo and Kazooie: Nut 'n' Bolts, a game he's been wanting to try for seven years.
Galak-Z: The Dimensional Review;8;Great; Galak-Z is a brutal, demanding, and ultimately rewarding 2D shooter.;Mike Mahardy died a lot during Galak-Z: The Dimensional. He's now terrified of space pirates.
Tembo The Badass Elephant Review;8;Great; Tembo‰Ûªs big action setpieces prove the old adage that great things come in small packages.;Heidi is glad that Game Freak has once again visited their roots in platforming games. She sees herself replaying Tembo regularly, much like another of her favorite Game Freak games, the Genesis platformer, Pulseman.
King's Quest Chapter 1: A Knight to Remember Review;8;Great; What‰Ûªs old is new again in A Knight to Remember, the first chapter in a new King‰Ûªs Quest saga that perfectly matches the spirit of the legendary adventure series.;Brett‰Ûªs eight hours spent in Daventry felt more like a trip back 25 years to the glory days of King‰Ûªs Quest, Police Quest, and the rest of the Sierra adventure classics.
Lost Dimension Review;7;Good; Lost Dimension successfully blends challenging tactical combat with unique judgment sequences that force you to eliminate various party members.;Josiah Renaudin enjoys saving the world from maniacal anime villains, and prefers to do so through turn-based combat. For the purposes of this review, he completed Lost Dimension and played through each of the side missions.
Etrian Odyssey Untold 2: The Fafnir Knight Review;7;Good; This enhanced remake of Etrian Odyssey 2 has a lot to offer both series veterans and newcomers.;Heidi has played every single entry in the Etrian Odyssey series. She didn‰Ûªt realize how much she really, really missed the War Magus class from EO2 until she got her hands on it again. She also silently judges you if you pick the orchestral soundtrack over the old-school FM synth sounds.
Rory McIlroy PGA Tour Review;4;Poor; Rory McIlroy PGA Tour is an empty, unimpressive debut lacking in both content and finish.;Josiah Renaudin has been golfing since the age of five and played four years on his high school varsity team. For the purposes of this review, he brought his created golfer to the top of the Official World Golf Rankings, competed in multiple online tournaments, and even had a hole-in-one.
Journey (PS4) Review;10;Essential; Journey has only improved with time, earning its status as one of the best games ever created.;Kevin has played Journey on the PS4 three times now, making for eight total Journey playthroughs in all. He considers Journey one of the best games ever made.
Card Hunter: Expedition to the Sky Citadel Review;8;Great; Card Hunter comes to Steam with the same skillful mix of classic RPG and card-styled gaming as its browser-based predecessor.;Over 20 hours in the AD&D-inspired Card Hunter made Brett long for a time machine, but he had to settle for just flipping through his old copies of ‰ÛÏTomb of Horrors‰Û and ‰ÛÏExpedition to the Barrier Peaks.‰Û
Victor Vran Review;6;Fair; Victor Vran treads familiar ground, bringing exciting combat to an overall sufficient action RPG.;Cameron Woolsey has spent many hours playing action RPGs, scouring their worlds, constantly on the lookout for shinier loot. Deep in his heart, he will always count Phantasy Star Online as his favorite, but he never turns down the opportunity to explore new horizons. For the sake of this review, Cameron played around 30 hours, reaching the highest level of 50, all the while hording a handful of legendary weapons that are his and his alone so back off.
Dreamfall Chapters Book 3: Realms Review;8;Great; Dreamfall Chapters positions itself for great things after a touching and successful Book 3.;Jay Pullman writes, podcasts, and wrangles three-legged cats when he‰Ûªs not playing video games. He spent 4-5 hours with Dreamfall Chapters Book 3 and feels pleasantly refreshed. Full Disclosure: Jay donated $25 to Dreamfall Chapters‰Ûª Kickstarter campaign.
Prototype Biohazard Bundle Review;5;Mediocre; With this Prototype bundle, the virus is back, but it's been rendered inert.;Justin Clark sank 20 hours apiece into the two Prototype games for this go-around. He has sincere regrets about not gluing a couple of boxes of spaghetti to his arms and going as James Heller for Halloween when Prototype 2 came out.
Blues and Bullets: Episode One Review;7;Good; Blues and Bullets makes its debut with a stylish first episode that sets a striking‰ÛÓif slightly uneven and glitchy‰ÛÓcrime noir tone.;Brett likes his film noir, but prefers it in novel form. Jim Thompson would have liked Blues and Bullets.
Trove Review;7;Good; Trove generally mixes elements of Minecraft and traditional MMOGs well, but it grows tedious in the late game.;Leif Johnson is a freelance writer who has played a ridiculous number of MMOGs, and he recently started playing Age of Conan again for reasons even he's not sure of. And he likes it. For the purposes of this review, he played Trove for about 30 hours.
Rocket League Review;9;Superb; Rocket League delivers all the refinements and improvements befitting a sports sequel, and is a brilliantly boisterous and enthralling game in its own right.;It took Miguel one match to get the appeal of Rocket League and about 30 more before he scored a bicycle kick goal that was intentional. As a fan of single player campaigns in sports video games, playing the 36-week season--the longest season allowable--was a no-brainer. He enjoyed scoring against bots from midfield at Rookie level and appreciated the option to increase the difficulty mid-season. He is equally satisfied with his above .500 online win average.
Trials Fusion: Awesome Level Max Edition Review;7;Good; The wackiest bits of Trials Fusion's Awesome Level Max DLC end too soon, but there's plenty of other content to savor.;Leif Johnson loves platformers of all types, and he's been doing the sidescrolling dirtbike thing ever since he picked up Excitebike in 1985. He's never actually ridden a dirtbike, but he's ridden plenty of horses, and thus he winced every time the unicorn landed on all fours. For the purposes of this review, he played the Awesome Level Max DLC for about nine hours.
F1 2015 Review;6;Fair; F1 2015 has the best on-circuit action the series has ever seen, buts serious technical issues, a dearth of game modes, and multiplayer which is functionally broken sour what is ...;Danny first fell in love with F1 games while playing Geoff Crammond's F1 Grand Prix on his Amiga 600. He is co-host of Giant Bomb's Formula One podcast Alt+F1 and frequently wakes up at 5AM to watch races live.
The Elder Scrolls Online: Tamriel Unlimited Review;6;Fair; Despite it's vastness and beauty, The Elder Scrolls Online: Tamriel Unlimited's halves never unite to form a consistent whole.;Don bought his Xbox 360 specifically for The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, and he's lost hundreds of hours between it and Skyrim. He spent circa 60 hours with The Elder Scrolls Online: Tamriel Unlimited for this review.
Life is Strange Episode Four Review;6;Fair; Life is Strange's penultimate episode abuses its own mechanics and drags the pace down, but bookends its slog with two powerful, well-worth-it gut punches.;Alexa Ray Corriea is in Life is Strange for the long haul, and played this latest episode exploring different options presented in previous episodes.
Game of Thrones: Episode Five ‰ÛÓ A Nest of Vipers Review;9;Superb; Game of Thrones' fifth episode is a return to what we expect from something attached to the HBO series: bloodshed, intrigue, and bitter heartbreak.;Alexa Ray Corriea played through A Nest of Vipers three times to explore all possible outcomes. They are all terrible and sad but she did it for you anyway.
Godzilla Review;3;Bad; Godzilla is a boring, badly-balanced game that asks you to pay a lot of money for too little content.;Kevin VanOrd loves big monsters, big robots, and big guns. He does not, however, like this Godzilla game, and after eight hours of drudgery, he cannot be convinced to return.
Guild of Dungeoneering Review;8;Great; Guild of Dungeoneering is deceptively simple but full of fun.;Justin Clark spent about 5 hours crawling dungeons to building up his guild into a flourishing estate. He has found himself wondering how they managed to keep the graveyard so pristine with the astonishingly high number of dead adventurers he‰Ûªs piled onto it over time.
Legends of Eisenwald Review;7;Good; Atmosphere and a good story make the tactical RPG Legends of Eisenwald a compelling trip back to Germany in the Middle Ages.;More than 20 hours in medieval Germany, and strategy veteran Brett is still looking for Martin Luther.
Lego Jurassic World Review;6;Fair; Lego Jurassic World is a joyful, brightly-colored tribute to Jurassic Park that fails to channel the franchise's trademark tension and excitement.;Jeremy Signor was obsessed with dinosaurs as a kid, and Jurassic Park holds a special place in his heart. He spent fifteen hours hoping the game would properly capture the spirit of the movies. Also, he still enjoys dinosaurs.
Traverser Review;6;Fair; Traverser boasts a fun presentation, but the gameplay doesn't always follow suit.;Leif Johnson is a freelance writer who has enjoyed 3D platformers ever since Super Mario 64 came out. For the purposes of this review, he played Traverser for around five hours.
God of War 3 Remastered Review;8;Great; God of War III on the PS4 is the same exciting game that it always was--just a little prettier.;Kevin VanOrd has played and enjoyed every God of War game except Ascension, which is still sitting on his shelf and waiting to be played. He still thinks God of War II is the best God of War, but hardly regretted the eight hours it took to play God of War III again.
Ronin Review;7;Good; Ronin is a challenging action platformer with vengeance on its mind.;Cameron Woolsey loves stealth games, and couldn‰Ûªt get enough of silently taking out enemies from the shadows in Ronin. For this review, Cameron played around eight hours, completing the campaign and playing some new-game-plus.
Dr. Mario: Miracle Cure Review;7;Good; Dr. Mario: Miracle Cure introduces a fresh new twist on an old formula.;Jason Venter willingly admits that he is not a Dr. Mario savant, but for the sake of this review he conquered all of the new puzzles and showed those viruses who the boss is. Unrelated: now he has a cold.
Whispering Willows Review;7;Good; Whispering Willows is modest in its scares and challenges, but is rich in heart.;Miguel beat Whispering Willows in three brisk, stump-free hours and managed to collect all the notes in the process. This playthrough has motivated Miguel to finish White Night and replay Fatal Frame. He resides on the former site of a newspaper office and assumes ghosts of deceased deadline-pressed editors frantically roam his house.
The Red Solstice Review;7;Good; Once you get through its rough exterior, The Red Solstice offers deep tactical action that's fun with friends.;Britton Peele wouldn't mind visiting Mars, but he'd rather not die there. He spent roughly 20 hours completing the game's single-player campaign and ranking up several times in multiplayer, despite dying more often than not.
Wander Review;2;Terrible; Wander is a broken and hollow shell of an MMO that lacks more than just combat.;Jefferson Geiger roamed for ten hours on the islands of Wander and won‰Ûªt return. He spent a whole summer grinding to level 60 in World of Warcraft and loves exploring environments in games like Gone Home and Journey. He wishes he did one of those things instead of play Wander.
Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition Review;6;Fair; The Special Edition of Devil May Cry 4 brings notable improvements, but they‰Ûªre not enough to cover up its repetitive core.;Josiah Renaudin has spent his fair share of time slicing and dicing demons as Dante. For the purposes of this review, he completed the campaign, tested each difficulty, and experimented with each additional characters‰Ûª special abilities.
Final Fantasy XIV: Heavensward Review;9;Superb; Square Enix's MMO has gone from turmoil to triumph, but can the latest expansion take it even further?;Pete has been playing Final Fantasy XIV since A Realm Reborn's closed beta in 2013, and just about managed to clear the Final Coil of Bahamut before Heavensward launched.
PlanetSide 2 Review (PS4) Review;7;Good; PlanetSide 2 on the PlayStation 4 suffers from a lot of technical issues--but not enough to dissuade you from the rigors of its massive battles.;Kevin played many dozens of hours of PlanetSide 2 on the PC, and spent dozens more with the PS4 version. He's not the best pilot, but he's killer with a rocket launcher. He's played different factions for review purposes, but his heart will always be with the Vanu.
Tales from the Borderlands: Episode Three ‰ÛÓ Catch a Ride Review;9;Superb; Tales from the Borderlands' third episode is its best yet, a shining example of Telltale's branching narratives and a gut-busting, heart-pounding thrill ride.;Alexa Ray Corriea went back to the previous episode and changed her final choice twice--then played through Catch a Ride exploring both options. Her mind was blown.
The Masterplan Review;5;Mediocre; Clumsy controls make The Masterplan more gawky than graceful.;Between Invisible Inc, Neon Struct, and The Masterplan, Justin Clark has been immersed in the stealth genre this year, to the point that he has taken a liking to kicking in bathroom doors and threatening toilets to self-flush at gunpoint, before demanding they tell him where the non-existent safe is. He has since been given a prescription copy of GTA V. By order of a city court.
Her Story Review;8;Great; In Her Story, an old game mechanic has been put to captivating new use.;Justin Clark was able to piece together the story in about 2 hours. As one of maybe 13 people on the planet who owned a Sega CD, he‰Ûªs no stranger to FMVs and things that don‰Ûªt last as long as you want them to.
Batman: Arkham Knight Review;7;Good; Arkham Knight is another slick and enjoyable Batman adventure, though what it brings to the series' table is not always for the best.;Kevin is now well into a new-game plus in Batman: Arkham Knight, and has spent about 30 hours with the game in all. He played the PlayStation 4 version provided by WB Games on a debug console. He welcomes debate on whether Arkham City or Arkham Asylum is the better game, but scoffs at anyone who thinks it's Arkham Origins.
Massive Chalice Review;6;Fair; Massive Chalice can create hilarious moments of eugenics disasters, but other elements leave a lot to be desired.;Don has been a fan of tactical RPGs since the Final Fantasy Tactics days, and XCOM: Enemy Unknown was a major event in his life a couple years back. He spent around 14 hours with Massive Chalice for review.
Dirty Bomb Review;5;Mediocre; Dirty Bomb is frantic and entertaining, but doesn‰Ûªt exactly sparkle with originality and stability.;Cameron Woolsey spent much of his youth playing twitch shooters like Unreal and Quake, and that experience helped him settle into Dirty Bomb without much difficulty. For the purpose of this review, Cameron spent around 30 hours shooting, reviving, bombing, and generally having a good time, despite the frequent problems. Splash Damage's official public relations provided game code, along with a statement that Dirty Bomb's open beta period is actually considered full, reviewable release.
Heroes of the Storm Review;9;Superb; Lots of colorful Blizzard characters cross paths in the sensational Heroes of the Storm.;Tyler Hicks is a seasoned MOBA veteran and longtime fan of Blizzard IPs Diablo and StarCraft, with thousands of hours in each. For this review, Tyler reached account level 22 in Heroes of the Storm and leveled up several characters to level 5.
Yoshi's Woolly World Review;6;Fair; Mario's super-powered sidekick takes the spotlight, but can he steal the show?;Rob resisted playing The Witcher 3 just so he could review Woolly World for you. Please understand.
Sym Review;4;Poor; Awkward platformer Sym speaks to a vulnerable issue, but it's difficult to figure out what exactly it's trying to say.;Jeremy Signor is extremely familiar with anxiety issues, having dealt with them himself, so he can relate to hiding from stressful situations. Even so, the five hours he spent with Sym didn't speak to him.
Shadowrun Chronicles: Boston Lockdown Review;3;Bad; Shadowrun Chronicles is a bad use of the Shadowrun license, and a bad tactical RPG.;A fan of all things Western RPG, Dan Starkey suffered through Boston Lockdown's boring, monotonous campaign before trying some co-op. Sadly, adding people didn't save a fundamentally dull game.
Kholat Review;4;Poor; Kholat's poor attempts to creep and confound you fail to capitalize on its terrific premise.;Kevin VanOrd loves snowy horror games
Interloper Review;8;Great; Interloper condenses a whole lot of RTS into a small package of smart tactics and challenging puzzles.;Brett spent five hours swimming around with his Sentinels in Interloper.
Technobabylon Review;8;Great; Technobabylon combines tricky puzzles with fantastic world-building and storytelling.;Leif Johnson is a freelance writer who's been a fan of cyberpunk ever since he found a used copy of Neuromancer in a dentist's office in the mid-1980s. For the purposes of this review, he played Technobabylon for about 10 hours, although much of that was just clicking around cluelessly. He wrote this review on a table by the Hermitage in St. Petersburg, Russia.
Splatoon Review;8;Great; Splatoon is surprising because it bucks trends that have held back shooters for years, opening the genre up to all comers, casual and hardcore alike.;Peter played Splatoon for the better part of two weeks and loved almost every minute of it. He wants more, and he wants it now.
Schrodinger's Cat And The Raiders Of The Lost Quark Review;5;Mediocre; Schrodinger's Cat is smarter than the average platformer, but still a pretty average platformer.;Justin Clark spent 6 hours with Schrodinger's Cat, an hour and half of which spent obsessively netting unconscious gluons before saying to hell with it. The fact that Justin was a Liberal Arts major and thus has no idea about how to science had no bearing on this review, he swears.
Carmageddon: Reincarnation Review;4;Poor; Carmageddon: Reincarnation is a tired and clunky reboot of a better game suited for a different time.;Cameron Woolsey played a lot of car combat games back in his prime, including Carmageddon and such gems like Vigilante 8. For the sake of this review, Cameron spent around 17 hours in the game, partly on his roof, partly tweaking graphics settings, but still managed to finish the single-player campaign and unlock all vehicles in the process.
The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing 3 Review;6;Fair; Van Helsing III is fun, but its reliance on old assets and disappointing brevity make this action role-playing game less than incredible.;Daniel Starkey was one of the first fans of the Van Helsing series. After the 10-hour campaign and some forays into both PvP and co-op multiplayer, he's finally ready to say goodbye to the land of Borgovia. He only wishes they were parting on better terms.
Puzzle & Dragons Z + Puzzle & Dragons: Super Mario Bros. Edition Review;7;Good; The two games in this package make for a solid introduction to Puzzle and Dragons‰Ûª collecting and matching mechanics, but they aren't as substantial as they should be.;Heidi opened up a bunch of friend slots on her mobile Puzzle and Dragons account just for you fine folks who actually read the whole review (and to clear any doubts about her PAD prowess). Add 313,548,207 to your pals list for some great helpers. Dark and Red leads preferred!
Stretchmo Review;7;Good; While there isn't much to the free section of ‰ÛÏfree-to-start‰Û Stretchmo, the full product is a pleasant puzzler.;Janine Hawkins dipped in and out of both Pushmo and Crashmo in the past, but left each feeling lukewarm. She had a much easier time sticking with Stretchmo thanks to its variety.
Neon Struct Review;6;Fair; Neon Struct is a retro stealth experience that is a bit too retro for its own good.;Justin Clark spent about 4 hours wandering the long halls and corridors of Neon Struct. Perhaps his biggest disappointment was not getting a twist ending where it‰Ûªs revealed Jillian is actually a sentient mass of fluorescent lighting made only for non-lethal killing.
Game of Thrones: Episode Four ‰ÛÓ Sons of Winter Review;5;Mediocre; Game of Thrones' fourth episode prioritizes verbal sparring over the physical kind, slowing down the action and packing in new twists to tension's detriment.;Alexa Ray Corriea played through Sons of Winter several times, exploring the consequence of each major decision.
Sunset Review;7;Good; Sunset is a creative, powerful story of personal, political, and social conflict.;Josiah Renaudin completed Sunset for the purposes of this review. Additionally, he started a new game and made different choices in order to see how the story changes.
Magicka 2 Review;7;Good; Magic combat and co-op play remain brilliant in Magicka 2, but the sadistic solo experience along with a few bugs and design problems cause some of this spell to fizzle.;Even after many hours of running around with his cowl on in both Magicka games, Brett will likely never be very good at hot-button spell-slinging. But he tries hard.
Magnetic: Cage Closed Review;3;Bad; Magnetic: Cage Closed's reliance on imprecise platforming and nondescript storytelling makes the game's prison setting an unintended and accurate metaphor.;Puzzle-platformers are easily Don's third favorite genre behind RPGs and 4X strategy games, but neither Magnetic: Cage Closed's platforming or puzzling were redeemable. He spent around 7 hours with the game.
Galactic Civilizations III Review;8;Great; The Galactic Civilizations series has returned with more ships, bigger maps, and new ways to explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate.;4X is Dan Starkey's favorite game genre. Starting with Civilization II, he's spent the past twenty years waiting for the perfect strategy game. Dan spent 48 on three games over the course of a week, and while he loved GalCivIII, he's still waiting.
Life is Strange Episode Three Review;8;Great; The third episode of Life is Strange marks the series' high point, with poignant emotional moments and a twist that turns the narrative on its head.;Alexa Ray Corriea can't stop rewinding time because she triple-guesses all of her choices. She played Chaos Theory twice, exploring both scenario options from the end of Episode Two.
Swords And Soldiers 2 Review;7;Good; It's light on features, but Swords and Soldiers II is successful at boiling an RTS down to its entertaining essentials.;Britton Peele spent a lot of time playing (and often cheating in) the Age of Empires games in his youth, and Swords and Soldiers reminded him of the series in positive ways. He spent five hours completing the story, but went back to replay several levels and play a number of local multiplayer matches.
Hatred Review;3;Bad; Hatred isn't fun, interesting, or titillating enough to command your time or attention.;Justin Clark was able to get through Hatred's campaign in about 3 1/2 hours. And that's all he's got to say about that.
Wolfenstein: The Old Blood Review;7;Good; The Old Blood's madcap attitude shines throughout its campaign, but the game fumbles when it strays from its Nazi-filled levels.;Jeremy Signor spent around ten hours killing Nazis, zombies, dogs, and robots. In the process, he realized he's been doing some variation of this for decades now. The more things change...
Not A Hero Review;7;Good; The humor won‰Ûªt always make you laugh, but Not a Hero‰Ûªs 2D action makes it worth your time.;The humor won‰Ûªt always make you laugh, but Not a Hero‰Ûªs 2D action makes it worth your time.
Invisible Inc. Review;7;Good; Invisible, Inc. has the right tools and the right talent, but it's not quite the flawless caper it almost was.;Justin Clark spent 13 hours with Invisible Inc, 8 on Beginner, 2 on normal, then an additional 3 getting shot at like crazy on Intermediate. Given there's a calm, determined female spy named Internationale, his biggest disappointment is that there isn't a psycho, gun-crazy Southern Belle named Domestique in the game.
Vertiginous Golf Review;7;Good; Vertigo, mini-putt, and steampunk come together rather well in the deeply weird Vertiginous Golf.;After sharpening his mini-putt skills in Vertiginous Golf, Brett‰Ûªs now ready to take on the local kids down at the amusement park.
Last Word Review;7;Good; Last Word is mechanically dense, but its consistently sharp writing and layered battle system shine through the noise.;Josiah Renaudin enjoys RPGs of all shapes and sizes--even those that replace swords with wordplay. For the purposes of this review, he completed Last Word and explored much of the side content.
Toren Review;5;Mediocre; Toren shoots for the moon but lands nowhere special.;Janine Hawkins played through Toren twice and still doesn't feel strongly about it. She has one single achievement left to complete, but that's not enough incentive to go back for thirds.
Windward Review;3;Bad; Windward is less of a high seas adventure and more of a soporific cruise for the geriatric crowd.;Don was intrigued by Windward's promise of exploration and playing your own style but either found himself falling asleep or bitterly cursing in frustration with every second during the hours he spent with the game.
Inside My Radio Review;7;Good; Inside My Radio's synesthetic experience is hypnotic.;Don is also a professional music journalist, and when he has the chance to write about something that combines video games and music--two of his greatest passions--he grabs it. He spent just over two hours with Inside My Radio.
Magicka: Wizard Wars Review;6;Fair; Magicka: Wizard Wars does a lot of things right, but there is too little under the cowl.;Magicka veteran Brett Todd put enough effort into learning the skill-based magical combat system of Magicka: Wizard Wars that he should be able to cast some real spells anytime now.
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt Review;10;Essential; The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is one of the best games ever made.;"Kevin VanOrd has played all three Witcher games and read several of the novels. He spent about 100 hours with The Witcher 3 on a PlayStation 4 debug system, a version that included the games' day-one patch. He uses the word ""ploughing"" in everyday speech."
Action Henk Review;7;Good; Action Henk is a speed-running platformer that keeps your heart racing.;Cameron Woolsey misses his glory days playing Sonic the Hedgehog, and Action Henk allowed him to relive that thrill for a short while. Now, does anyone know of some sturdy jeans? I have this hill I‰Ûªd like to try.
StarDrive 2 Review;6;Fair; StarDrive 2 is a competent 4X entry, but lacks standout features and is hampered by its ground combat.;Nick Capozzoli has spent thousands of hours eXploring, eXpanding, eXploiting, and eXterminating his way across galaxies. For the purposes of this review, he played through multiple campaigns on a variety of settings.
Project CARS Review;8;Great; Project CARS offers a sharp racing simulation with an open-ended structure.;Austin Walker spent 15 hours hugging the corners and shifting gears in Project CARS, but this isn‰Ûªt his first race. He grew up on Gran Turismo, learned to drive on Forza Motorsport, and isn‰Ûªt afraid to admit that he misses Project Gotham Racing.
JumpJet Rex Review;5;Mediocre; This 8-bit throwback perfectly emulates the era, for better and for worse.;Justin Clark was able to get through JumpJet Rex in about 4 1/2 hours total. His first ever thrown controller was at the wee age of 9, after losing his last turtle in the final Technodrome level of the NES Ninja Turtles game. It has been 12 years since he last threw a controller, during a particularly disastrous Contra: Shattered Soldier run. He didn't quite get to that point with Jump Jet Rex, but he thought about it reeeal hard.
Attack On Titan: Humanity In Chains Review;4;Poor; The anime and manga's kinetic action may seem primed for a video game adaptation, but Attack on Titan: Humanity in Chains is not likely what you were hoping for.;Miguel watched and enjoyed the Attack on Titan anime and can only fantasize how much better it would‰Ûªve looked had it been produced in the 1980‰Ûªs. He has not read the manga nor has he played the visual novels. Combined, Miguel needed about 12 hours to clear the Story Mode and World Mode.
The Weaponographist Review;7;Good; Speedy arena combat and a cartoon personality make The Weaponographist a retro-flavored dungeon worth crawling.;A dozen or so hours later and Brett's no smarter, but his wrists hurt a whole lot from the merry mayhem in The Weaponographist.
Remnants of Isolation Review;5;Mediocre; Remnants of Isolation leans too heavily on a narrative that fails to deliver an emotional punch.;Josiah Renaudin was raised on turn-based RPGs, arguing to this day that Final Fantasy VIII is the best game Square has ever released. For the purpose of this review, he played Remnants of Isolation to completion and saw each of the three endings.
Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor 2 Record Breaker Review;8;Great; Devil Survivor 2: Record Breaker expands tremendously on an already excellent strategy RPG.;Has it really been three years since the original Devil Survivor 2‰Ûªs release? Heidi thought she remembered every detail her original outing, but replaying the Septentriones scenario in Record Breaker brought back a lot of memories. Also, she still giggles when she hears characters say ‰ÛÏSaiduq‰Û because she imagines an all-powerful Pokemon.
Color Guardians Review;3;Bad; Color Guardians offers relentless difficulty and beautiful visuals but not much else.;Jason Venter has jumped through magical worlds and even restored the occasional spot of color over the years, but he has seldom faced a stiffer challenge than the one he encountered within Color Guardians as he clawed his way to the final battle for the purposes of this review.
BoxBoy! Review;8;Great; This 3DS game's disarming simplicity is a ruse that hides an addictive depth.;After just over 10 hours, Justin collected all of the crowns, unlocked all the costumes, and had a lot of fun.
Verdun Review;6;Fair; Verdun brings multiplayer shooting to World War I in all its glory, as well as the frequent boredom.;Cameron Woolsey has played dozens of military shooters, but none could prepare him for the more grounded life in the trenches. For the sake of this review, Cameron played about 20 hours, claiming enemy territory while occasionally meeting his match against barbed wire.
Age of Wonders III: Eternal Lords Review;8;Great; The excellent Eternal Lords adds two new races, a new class, and lots of other features to an already solid core.;Dan Starkey's fantasized about having a benevolent race of zombies for years. After 15 hours of tinkering in Eternal Lords, he finally got his wish.
Lost Orbit Review;7;Good; It's simple and relatively short, but Lost Orbit's high-speed dodging action is fun while it lasts.;Britton Peele's affinity for collecting things quickly led him to spend too much time playing NiGHTS: Into Dreams as a kid. He made sure to collect all the obtanium strewn around space in Lost Orbit, completing the game in under three hours but going back for some high score attempts afterward. He has has died in space more than 450 times so far.
Halo: Spartan Strike Review;7;Good; This follow-up to Halo: Spartan Assault gives as much as it takes, adding Promethean weapons while depriving you of multiplayer.;Since his last Halo review (Spartan Assault), Miguel‰Ûªs time with the series were spent on the Halo 5: Guardians beta and about 10 combined hours on Halo: The Master Chief Collection. It took Miguel about 5 hours to get through Halo: Spartan Strike, which included some Assault Ops-driven replays.
I Am Bread Review;5;Mediocre; In I Am Bread, both the joke and the game carry on far too long.;Justin Clark spent 5 hours on I Am Bread, averaging roughly an hour a stage.
State of Decay: Year One Survival Edition Review;5;Mediocre; State of Decay still hasn't become the game it wants to be.;Don's never really thought too much about what he'd do if there was a zombie apocalypse, but State of Decay forced him to. He spent around 23 hours with the game.
Ziggurat Review;7;Good; Ziggurat is a short but fast-paced roguelike shooter with only a few minor hang-ups.;Cameron Woolsey spent more than 12 hours sprinting through rooms and blasting skeletons in Ziggurat. He completed it multiple times, unlocking seven characters. His favorite so far is Kraz the Novice, a female wizard with exceptional wand mastery.
Mortal Kombat X Review;8;Great; Mortal Kombat X successfully continues the tradition of mixing a fighting game with gore-laced slapstick.;Peter got his first taste of Mortal Kombat with the original arcade game, and with only a few exceptions, has kept up with the series since. He spent the majority of his time with the PlayStation 4 version of the game for this review, taking his profile to level 38, and his faction profile to level 36.
Tower of Guns Review;8;Great; The fantastic Tower of Guns combines the elegant dodging dance of bullet hell gameplay with a first-person shooter roguelike;Tyler Hicks has played console shooters since the days of Goldeneye. At one point, he was number one on the Tower of Guns leaderboard, and currently sits at number six, with several multiple-hour dives into the game.
Geometry Wars 3: Dimensions Evolved Review;8;Great; Geometry Wars 3: Dimensions Evolved advances the challenge, satisfaction, and frustration of Geometry Wars 3 at every turn.;If Don stopped and thought about how many hours he lost playing Geometry Wars Retro Evolved 2 in his dorm room (especially Pacifism mode), he'd experience a mild existential crisis. Don spent about 14 hours with the expansion (and at least two dozen hours with the base game when it was released).
We Are Doomed Review;5;Mediocre; We Are Doomed delivers a satisfying-feeling twin stick shooter, but does so without any flair whatsoever.;Jeremy Signor is terrible at twin stick shooters, but managed to beat the game in relatively short order. You probably can beat it in actual short order, though.
Crypt of the NecroDancer Review;8;Great; Rhythm and roguelike sync up in a fun twist on a common concept.;Britton Peele doesn't spend a lot of time in crypts, but he did spend enough time playing Dance Dance Revolution as a teen that he was sure his rhythm skills would get him a girlfriend (they didn't). He spent more than 10 hours with Crypt of the Necrodancer for this review, beating the game with multiple characters.
The Charnel House Trilogy Review;5;Mediocre; The horror of The Charnel House Trilogy makes a slight mark, but it's not a lasting one.;Kevin VanOrd loves creepy games, adventure games, and narrative games, but The Charnel House Trilogy didn't click with him during the 90 minutes he spent playing it. Full disclosure: The Charnel House Trilogy's author, Ashton Raze, used to write reviews for GameSpot.
Slow Down Bull Review;6;Fair; Slow Down, Bull is a friendly and occasionally frustrating game with plenty of good morals to share and an admirable goal.;Cameron Woolsey was never that much of an artist, and not nearly as dedicated to the craft as Esteban the bull. During the course of this review, Cameron smiled more often than he grumbled in frustration, though he may have done so a good few times.
Slender: The Arrival Review;7;Good; With the move to current-gen consoles and a few new levels, horror hit Slender continues to offer up scares, but at the cost of its own mystique.;Daniel Starkey has now played through Slender: The Arrival three times (once on PC, twice on consoles), and is convinced that he'll have nightmares about the ghastly ghoulie for the rest of his life.
Broken Age: Act 2 Review;6;Fair; Broken Age: Act II solves nearly all of the sins of the first half of the game while stumbling into a fair share of new ones.;Don is a Double Fine type of guy. He'll talk your ear off about the Milkman Conspiracy. (The truth is out there.) Don spent around 9 hours with Act II of Broken Age, although a good hour and a half was backtracking.
Infinite Crisis Review;6;Fair; Infinite Crisis is not the hero to save the MOBA genre.;Tyler Hicks could be labeled a MOBA connoisseur if such a thing existed, he has tasted and sampled a full array of the DotA-cloned games. For the purposes of this review, he reached account level 12 and dominated several Coast City games from the Urban Jungle.
Titan Souls Review;7;Good; Titan Souls stretches its simple structure to its breaking point, but before that time comes, it's an intriguing game and a fair but fun challenge.;Kevin VanOrd finished Titan Souls in about four hours, and is tired of people comparing it (and lots of other games) to Dark Souls just because it's hard and requires repetition. Kevin is also, apparently, a curmudgeon.
Assassin's Creed Chronicles: China Review;6;Fair; It is the most sumptuous and stealth-focused Assassin's Creed yet, but Chronicles: China doesn't assemble its pieces into a gratifying whole.;Kevin VanOrd has played almost every Assassin's Creed game, though he hasn't yet finished Unity or even started Rogue--and isn't sure he ever will. He also fondly recalls Assassin's Creed II: Discovery, a 2D Assassin's Creed that captured the series' spirit better than Chronicles: China does.
VoidExpanse Review;4;Poor; VoidExpanse's boring rendition of space exploration makes staying on Earth the more appealing option.;Kevin VanOrd has explored space (digitally) more times than he can count. He played VoidExpanse for a couple dozen hours. He finds this byline almost as boring as he found VoidExpanse.
Dungeons 2 Review;6;Fair; Dungeons 2 is a decent mashup of Dungeon Keeper and real-time strategy conventions, but oversimplification keeps it from being a keeper.;Leif Johnson is a freelance game critic from Goliad, Texas who's been raiding and keeping dungeons since the the '80s, and who kinda sorta enjoyed Dungeons when it first came out in 2011. For the purposes of this review, he played Dungeons 2 for around 14 hours.
Affordable Space Adventures Review;8;Great; The fun and atmospheric Affordable Space Adventures lives up to its quirky title.;Jason Venter has never left Earth's atmosphere, but he likes Velcro and Tang as much as the next guy. He spent around eight hours with Affordable Space Adventures prior to writing his review, and played through to the closing credits.
Harold Review;7;Good; Harold is an infinite-runner platformer that's as pretty as it is punishing.;No stranger to soul-crushing games, Matt didn't expect Harold to be so difficult. After not achieving better than 3rd place in any race--and failing to finish others--he was set straight faster than a trouble-making toddler in a time out.
Paperbound Review;7;Good; Paperbound is a thrilling multiplayer arena game, but too few game modes and lack of an online feature makes it only an occasional party favorite.;Cameron Woolsey spent several hours with Paperbound and several friends. He now counts Paperbound among his favorite party games, and looks forward to taking the monk, his favorite character, back to the winner‰Ûªs circle in the near future.
Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin Review;9;Superb; Dark Souls II comes to current gen with a vengeance.;Justin Clark has been getting the holy hell kicked out of him by From Software since Demon's Souls. After 105 hours, and deaths numbering surely into the thousands, this new version was no different, but this represents the first time he has actually persevered and beat the game. Full of hubris, he currently awaits a copy of Bloodborne, while re-enacting that torch scene from Predator on top of his roof.
Worlds of Magic Review;2;Terrible; Worlds of Magic is the spiritual successor to the 1994 game Master of Magic, but it disappoints even by 1990s standards.;Dan Starkey spent about 24 hours waiting for something interesting to happen in Worlds of Magic. He's kept up with the recent influx of fantasy 4X games, and Worlds of Magic is the worst by far.
Pillars of Eternity Review;8;Great; Pillars of Eternity is a lengthy and enjoyable role-playing game that springs from a time-honored tradition.;Kevin has played every Infinity Engine game several times over, though he thinks Planescape: Torment remains at the apex. He does have a fondness for Icewind Dale, however, due to its fantastic soundtrack. He finished Pillars of Eternity in about 55 hours, with good reputations with Gilded Vale, Defiance Bay, Dyrford Village, Twin Elms, Knights of the Crucible, Ovates of the Golden Grove, and The Fangs. The Dozens, House Doemenel, and Ethik Nol hate him, though.
Bastion Review;8;Great; Bastion remains as strong of a game as it was in 2011, but there's no need to buy this version if you already own it.;Leif Johnson is a freelancer who writes about games on a ranch north of Goliad, Texas, which has known its fair share of calamities. Fortunately, even though he's pretty good with a bow, he's never had to use it against slimy monsters of the like in Bastion. For the purposes of this review, he played Bastion for around six hours.
Etrian Mystery Dungeon Review;7;Good; Etrian Mystery Dungeon is a punishing RPG that's difficult to put down thanks to a rich supply of loot and deep dungeons.;Josiah Renaudin delves into his fair share of virtual dungeons, picking up anything shiny that catches his eye. For the purpose of this review, he played Etrian Mystery Dungeon to completion and finished many of the quests following the story's end. The game was provided for review by Atlus.
Story of Seasons Review;7;Good; Despite its nagging restrictions, Story of Seasons is an absorbing farming game with a wonderful sense of progression.;Josiah (begrudgingly) worked on a farm in his younger years, and has spent countless hours with the Harvest Moon series. For the purpose of this review, he explored the different seasons and expanded his farm far beyond its humble beginnings.
Three Fourths Home: Extended Edition Review;8;Great; Three Fourths Home is a tense and personal interactive short story.;Austin Walker has spent hundreds of hours driving around aimlessly at night. He also spent last year playing interactive fiction games like 80 Days, Elegy for a Dead World, and Skulljhabit.
Xenoblade Chronicles 3D Review;8;Great; Xenoblade Chronicles 3D is a valiant attempt at bringing an ambitious and expansive RPG to the handheld realm. For the most part it works, but the original undoubtedly shines brighter ...;Having ploughed over 100 happy hours into the original game, John was more than ready to put the 3DS re-release through its paces. He now craves something that can be completed in a weekend.
Sunless Sea Review;6;Fair; Amazing writing and a good sense of discovery makes Sunless Sea's glacial pace and mismatched roguelike elements worth plodding through.;Jeremy Signor went through six different zee captains over 80 hours to bring you this review, and he still has yet to unravel all of what the Unterzee has to offer.
Life is Strange Episode Two Review;7;Good;" Life is Strange still suffers from some problematic dialogue and ""gamey"" sequences, but the emotional payoff is worth the effort.";Alexa Ray Corriea played through Life is Strange's second episode multiple times to see just how much impact she had on Max's world. She cried every time.
Dragon Age: Inquisition - Jaws of Hakkon Review;7;Good; Jaws of Hakkon recalls the best bits Dragon Age: Inquisition, with a couple of caveats.;Austin Walker has spent hundreds of hours in Dragon Age‰Ûªs world of Thedas over the last six years. When he isn‰Ûªt slaying dragons and fighting the blight, he‰Ûªs exploring the wastelands of Fallout or zooming across the galaxy of Mass Effect. He was last seen knee-deep in the sewers of Bloodborne‰Ûªs Yharnum. Send help.
MLB 15: The Show Review;8;Great; Minor refinements have noticeable impact on MLB 15: The Show, another rousing simulation of the national pastime.;Brett spent the better part of a week getting lost in one of his favorite rites of spring, the latest edition of MLB: The Show.
Dyscourse Review;7;Good; Dyscourse's charming writing and sense of urgency makes this island one on which you won't mind getting lost.;Don loves Lost. It's one of his top five favorite shows ever. And Dyscourse is a way better Lost video game than Via Domus was. He spent a little over 3 hours with the game over the course of three playthroughs.
Borderlands: The Handsome Collection Review;8;Great; Borderlands: The Handsome Collection rolls out enhanced visuals and a massive amount of content, though problems with its weaker half prevent it from completely reaching the stars.;Cameron Woolsey has carved a legacy for himself on Pandora and Elpis. He has slipped into the shadows as a haiku-reciting cyber ninja, and annoyed the hell out of his allies as yammering, wheeled trashcan robot. With The Handsome Collection, he plans on doing it all again, while looking forward to his next adventure on Pandora.
Axiom Verge Review;8;Great; Axiom Verge is an excellent example of inspired game design that takes old ideas and improves upon them, leaving a mark that won't soon be forgotten.;Peter spent nearly 20 hours playing Axiom Verge, and still can't get enough of it.
Dreamfall Chapters Book Two: Rebels Review;7;Good; Book Two's excellent cast of characters kicks Dreamfall Chapters into action.;Jay Pullman‰Ûªs favorite adventure game of all time is The Longest Journey, even though he still gets a migraine whenever he sees a rubber duck. He spent over 10 hours with Dreamfall Chapters‰Ûª second episode and needs a nap. Full disclosure: Jay donated $25 to Dreamfall Chapters‰Ûª Kickstarter campaign.
Bloodborne Review;9;Superb; Bloodborne's excellent action, beautiful artistry, and religious melodrama make it another must-play in the Demon's Souls tradition.;Kevin VanOrd's favorite game of the preceding generation is Dark Souls, so he was prepared for the challenge that lay before him. He finished Bloodborne in about 60 hours, at level 90, and beat several--but not all--of its optional bosses. He is now at level 101 and two bosses into a new-game-plus.
Game of Thrones: Episode Three ‰ÛÒ The Sword in the Darkness Review;8;Great; Telltale's journey through Westeros has hit a high point.;Alexa Ray Corriea is a masochist and played through Episode Three four times in an attempt to get every possible outcome. Her poor little heart can't take it anymore.
Resogun Defenders Review;7;Good; Resogun: Defenders delivers more energetic action in two new modes.;Peter played through both Protector mode and Commando mode for as long as his thumbs and eyes could handle, and still went back in from one more attempt at a high score.
Sid Meier's Starships Review;4;Poor; Sid Meier's Starships stretches a thin premise over barebones gameplay systems.;Nick played numerous games of Sid Meier's Starships for the purposes of this review, using game code provided by 2K Games. He wishes it didn't run out of ideas just a couple of hours in.
Woolfe - The Red Hood Diaries Review;4;Poor; Underneath Woolfe's pretty veneer lies a broken, paper-thin game.;Justin Clark was able to get through the available missions in a shade under 3 hours, with an estimated 15 minutes total spent rolling his eyes at the poetry.
Resident Evil: Revelations 2 - Episode Four Review;7;Good; Claire and Barry's trip to the island from hell is almost over, but how it ends is up to you.;Peter played through Episode Four twice (and part of Episode Three) during the course of this review.
Frozen Cortex Review;7;Good; Frozen Cortex has developed an entertainingly simple, scalable future sport.;Nick Capozzoli played sixteen hours of Frozen Cortex for the purpose of this review. His favorite multiplayer match he played was a 2-0 grind-it-out victory because DEFENSE WINS CHAMPIONSHIPS.
LA Cops Review;3;Bad; Playing LA Cops is like doing hard time.;Jason Venter spent around six hours with LA Cops, which was time enough to complete the campaign and play around with post-game content and multiple difficulty settings. He was last spotted wishing the game's second half were as enjoyable as its first half.
Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball Review;6;Fair; It‰Ûªs an audiovisual treat, but Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball just doesn‰Ûªt have staying power.;Josiah Renaudin never got picked first for dodgeball in gym class, but he still knows how to throw with some serious heat. For the purpose of this review, he tested all of the game‰Ûªs single and multiplayer offerings, spending hours on the neon battlefield.
Tales from the Borderlands: Episode Two ‰ÛÓ Atlas Mugged Review;8;Great; Tales from the Borderlands continues to tickle your funny bone and warm your heart with its second episode.;Alexa Ray Corriea tried several different paths through Atlas Mugged, and ultimately, all of them made her snort-laugh.
Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel - Claptastic Voyage Review;6;Fair; Claptastic Voyage tries to shine with awesome new weapons, enemy types, and some incredible environments, but lackluster missions tarnish the luster.;Cameron Woolsey has spent dozens and dozens of hours shooting and looting across Pandora and its moon. Borderlands 2 is his favorite of the series, but Claptrap will always be his first choice as vault hunter. For this review, Cameron spent around 10 hours, completing the main mission and all the side quests.
There Came An Echo Review;4;Poor; In this strategy game where you command real-time tactical battles entirely with your voice, the greatest threat is the voice recognition system itself.;Daniel spent roughly ten hours talking to his squad members and trying to get them to listen, alternately tweaking the voice recognition settings and just using the mouse to actually issue commands instead.
Shelter 2 Review;6;Fair; Shelter returns, bigger than before, yet somehow lesser for it.;Justin Clark was able to get through Shelter 2 in about two hours after two dismal false starts, one in which the cubs starved to death, and another in which all the cubs got eaten by wolves. Fact of life: You're not a real parent unless you've had to bite your kid on the neck and drag him away before he gets eaten by wolves.
Bladestorm: Nightmare Review;5;Mediocre; A mix of Musou, strategy, and pure insanity, Bladestorm ends up missing the mark with all three.;Justin Clark spent 10 hours on the Hundred Years War scenario, and five on Nightmare. His favorite memory of the game came from his mother, a retired history teacher who, when told about evil Joan of Arc's story, said, ‰ÛÏThat sounds like something she'd do.‰Û
White Night Review;6;Fair; White Night hints at a horror story of quality, but it's hidden in the shadows of tedium and visual ambiguity.;Britton Peele is afraid of being alone in the dark, and he's smart enough to keep a flashlight handy instead of relying on matchsticks. He finished White Night after seven hours of play time, gathering most of the collectibles along the way.
Deathtrap Review;7;Good; Deathtrap is a solid genre mash-up that goes on the (tower) defensive.;Justin Clark spent about 10 hours running through Deathtrap's dungeons, primarily as a sorceress, and ended up at level 17. For the record, his favorite deathtraps were the frost beam, the spear trap, and the Arby's about 3 miles down the road from his old apartment.
Trash TV Review;6;Fair; Trash TV is a fun sidescrolling puzzler about weapon-wielding TVs, but its conventional platforming and short running time spoil some of the fun.;Leif Johnson is a freelancer who writes about games on a ranch north of Goliad, Texas, where he often has to contend with roosters crowing as he plays games like Trash TV. For the purposes of this review, he played Trash TV for around five hours, using the second playthrough as an attempt to pull off a speed run.
Code Name S.T.E.A.M Review;4;Poor; Code Name: S.T.E.A.M. fails to live up to its potential, offering a clunky and frustrating tactical experience.;Austin Walker has spent the last few years enjoying the renaissance of tactical RPGs. He dumped dozens of hours into XCOM, devoured Shadowrun Returns, and leaped for joy at the PC re-release of Valkyria Chronicles. He even drew a chart to plan his Fire Emblem: Awakening character pairings.
Ori and the Blind Forest Review;9;Superb; Ori and the Blind Forest is a rapturous platformer that is as fun as it is beautiful.;Kevin VanOrd spent about 12 hours with Ori and the Blind Forest, but has yet to find every collectible and earn every skill upgrade. It is the first game of 2015 that has made him imagine putting it on his end-of-year top 10 list.
Final Fantasy Type-0 HD Review;8;Great; Final Fantasy Type-0's storyline may not be the most engaging, but it's combat system makes it hard to put down.;Alexa Ray Corriea took close to 30 hours to save the world of Orience. This fantasy is definitely not her final one.
Resident Evil: Revelations 2 - Episode Three Review;8;Great; The third episode of Resident Evil: Revelations 2 takes the partner system and the story to great places.;Peter played through Episode Three in just under three hours.
DmC: Devil May Cry Definitive Edition Review;9;Superb; In its Definitive Edition form, DmC Devil May Cry isn't just a better version of DmC--it's a bonafide hack 'n' slash classic.;Mark is a huge hack 'n' slash fan and has reviewed the likes of the amazing Bayonetta 2, and well as the original DmC: Devil May Cry. He played through the Definitive Edition with Hardcore and Turbo modifiers activated on Nephilim difficulty.
Mario Party 10 Review;6;Fair; While there are some moments to be had with Mario Party 10's minigames, it doesn't have the depth or the challenge to hold your attention for long.;Having grown up with the NES and Gameboy, Mark has long been a big Nintendo fan. For the purposes of this review, Mark enlisted the help of the GameSpot UK crew, as well as members of sister sites XCAR and CNET for several trips round the board.
Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number Review;9;Superb; Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number is a challenging and stylish game which entertains throughout, and delights in forcing you out of your comfort zone.;Danny is a lifelong fan of electronic music and loved the first Hotline Miami. Upon completing Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number, he spent $70 on the limited edition vinyl LP and returned to complete it again on hard mode. He reviewed the PC version mostly using the keyboard & mouse.
Battlefield: Hardline Review;7;Good; As Battlefield leaves the battlefield, Visceral Games tailors the series‰Ûª distinct vehicular-based multiplayer for the crime-ridden streets of Miami and L.A. with mostly positive results.;Miguel‰Ûªs review is based on 18 hours in multiplayer across all its modes, and completion of the campaign on Expert difficulty. He still grins that the thought of holding up another braindead thief in the single-player mode, while Hardline‰Ûªs stealth gameplay makes him crave a Metal Gear Solid marathon.
Q*Bert Rebooted Review;3;Bad; Q*bert: Rebooted will leave you struggling with awful controls when you‰Ûªre not nodding off to the tedium.;Cameron Woolsey grew up playing his dad‰Ûªs Atari 2600, and grew up with icons such as Pac-Man, Frogger, and of course Q*bert. He still believes that a proper return for Q*bert is possible, but Q*bert: Rebooted isn‰Ûªt it.
Lords of the Fallen - Ancient Labyrinth Review;3;Bad; Lords of the Fallen's long-awaited add-on is an unimaginative rip-off.;Kevin VanOrd loved Lords of the Fallen. Imagine his disappointment when Ancient Labyrinth turned out to be so, so unnecessary. It took him about 30 minutes to reach The Keeper, and a good 10 tries to defeat it.
OlliOlli2 Review;8;Great;" OlliOlli2 adds few changes to the original game's formula, but ""more of the same"" is enough to make this excellent sequel a consistent joy.";The original OlliOlli was one of Britton Peele's favorite games of 2014. In OlliOlli2 he cleared every Amateur stage, completed many of the game's challenges, and nailed hundreds of perfect grinds before writing this review.
Mario vs. Donkey Kong: Tipping Stars Review;5;Mediocre; Mario vs. Donkey Kong: Tipping Stars takes too long before it truly tickles your brain.;"Don was never much of a Lego kid, but ""construction puzzlers"" like World of Goo have always been fun diversions. Don spent around 5 hours with Mario vs. Donkey Kong: Tipping Stars and is considering going back to beat those tough bonus levels soon."
Homeworld Remastered Collection Review;8;Great; Not every change in this collection is for the best, but Homeworld and Homeworld 2 remain gorgeous classics that withstand the test of time.;Homeworld is one of Kevin VanOrd's lifetime top-ten games. He has played it and its sequel many times, and he was happy to again revisit its epic strategizing. For this review, he finished both campaigns, with took him about 16 hours in all, give or take, and played a number of one-off skirmishes.
Resident Evil: Revelations 2 - Episode Two Review;6;Fair; Resident Evil: Revelations 2 - Episode 2 offers a few great action sequences, but it's still plagued by mundane puzzles and forced reliance on your partner.;Peter breezed through episode two of Resident Evil: Revelations 2 in about two hours, and was glad it only took 36 minutes to complete Barry's chapter.
Dragon Ball: Xenoverse Review;6;Fair; Dragon Ball Xenoverse doesn‰Ûªt excel as a fighting game, but the customization options and fresh story beats add a new spin to a stagnant series.;Josiah Renaudin has seen every Dragon Ball Z saga at least seven times, and is still recovering from Dragon Ball Evolution. For the purpose of this review, he played Xenoverse to completion and created a character using each of the provided species.
Oreshika: Tainted Bloodlines Review;8;Great; The Vita gets some more JRPG love, but with a remarkable twist.;Justin Clark's clan went through 9 generations of his clan before writing his review. His only regret is sleeping with the wolf god. It gave all the kids on that side ratty green hair. And the mange, he's pretty sure. Don't ask where.
Aaru's Awakening Review;4;Poor; Aaru's Awakening is gorgeous to behold and a chore to play.;Kevin VanOrd is currently playing Rayman Legends, whose fluid gameplay provides a sharp contrast to Aaru's Awakening's clumsiness. He played Aaru's Awakening for about five hours, two of which were spent trying to finish the game's third boss.
Republique Review;8;Great; Strong dystopian storytelling powers this fascinating and fresh take on the stealth genre.;Justin Clark got through all three available episodes in about 5 hours, spent a half hour frantically trying to find out if there was a release date for Episode 4, and 15 minutes screaming at an uncaring laptop screen that there isn't one yet.
Resident Evil: Revelations 2 - Episode One Review;7;Good; Resident Evil: Revelations 2 gets off to a rough start with poor writing and safe design choices, but it's redeemed by strong doses of tension during the second act.;Peter beat the first episode of Revelations 2 in less than three hours before giving co-op a try, and he spent a few more hours chasing high scores in raid mode as both Barry and Claire.
Oblitus Review;8;Great; Oblitus is a entertaining and challenging 2D roguelike inspired by Dark Souls, with only a few issues marring its success.;Leif Johnson is a South Texan who loves platformers and Dark Souls, so playing Oblitus was a match made in Boletaria. He also loves the ridiculously awesome posters that were designed to hype Oblitus' release. For the purposes of this review, he dodged condors and stabbed forest mutants for around eight hours.
Hand of Fate Review;7;Good; Hand of Fate blends various elements of role-playing games and card games into a single, satisfying romp.;Kevin VanOrd has been playing role-playing games longer than he can remember. (Insert old joke here.) He has spent 20 hours or so with Hand of Fate, playing through the campaign and seeking success in Endless Mode.
Screamride Review;7;Good; Screamride is good, destructive fun in spite of some frustrating limits on creation.;Kevin VanOrd has rarely ridden a roller coaster he didn't like. His first was The Big Bad Wolf at Busch Gardens Williamsburg, and he never looked back. He played Rollercoaster Tycoon and Rollercoaster Tycoon 2 religiously, and of the hundred hours he spent with Rollercoaster Tycoon 3, at least a dozen were spent creating fireworks displays. Kevin spent about a dozen hours with Screamride, completing the career and digging into creation.
Helldivers Review;8;Great; Helldivers is a persistent online universe rich in combat but low on story.;Cameron Woolsey is no stranger to playing a bug-stomping space marine. He‰Ûªs always on the lookout for new planets to claim and new foes to liberate--hopefully with a big space gun. For this review, Cameron played more than 25 hours, reaching level 16, and making it all the way to the bug home planet before being kindly, but firmly, asked to leave.
Grow Home Review;8;Great; Grow Home combines experimental animation and beautiful world-building to create something unique.;Austin Walker finds himself playing lots of open world games with vertical exploration, like Saints Row 4 and the Assassin‰Ûªs Creed series. When he isn‰Ûªt scaling rooftops, he‰Ûªs digging into intimate games like Bientot l‰Ûªete and Thirty Flights of Loving.
Heroes of Might & Magic III - HD Edition Review;6;Fair; Heroes of Might & Magic III is still an all-time classic, although there are better and cheaper ways to revisit the past than this HD remake.;Brett lives in the past pretty much all the time, anyhow, but even more so this last week thanks to the high-res version of 1999 on offer in HOMM III HD.
Criminal Girls: Invite Only Review;4;Poor; Criminal Girls' interesting combat isn't enough to legitimize this tawdry slog through lifeless dungeons.;Josiah Renaudin often finds himself playing the oddest imports coming out of Japan, spending hours crawling through dungeons and picking up side quests. For the purposes of this review, he scoured every floor of Hell in Criminal Girls.
Kirby and the Rainbow Curse Review;5;Mediocre; Kirby and the Rainbow Curse oversimplifies its mechanics, making for an experience alternating between frustrating and dull.;Alexa Ray Corriea stuck with Kirby all the way to the end for Rainbow Curse. Everything is rainbows.
Total War: Attila Review;7;Good; Total War: Attila is an arranged marriage between a capable (and aging) battle simulator, and a fussy political one.;Nick Capozzoli is no stranger to war of the most total variety. He spent a few dozen hours with Total War: Attila, as the Huns, the Vandals, the Ostrogoths, and the Sassanids in their grand campaigns, as well as a smattering of one-off historical battles.
The Legend of Candlewind: Nights & Candles Review;2;Terrible; Even the most committed retro RPGer should pass on the appalling Legend of Candlewind.;Brett needs a better Eye of the Beholder clone, or a trip back to 1991 where he can play the real thing all over again.
Elite: Dangerous Review;7;Good; Elite: Dangerous is an inch deep, and 100,000 light years wide.;Nick Capozzoli spent dozens of hours in Elite: Dangerous, traveling, trading, fighting, and discovering new and interesting ways to run afoul of space station security systems.
The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask 3D Review;9;Superb; New time management tools and tweaked battles make Majora‰Ûªs Mask 3D a comfortable fit for Nintendo‰Ûªs handheld.;Alexa Ray Corriea has met with a terrible fate. But she has successfully ushered Termina into better days without a leering satellite plummeting towards it.
Apotheon Review;8;Great; Apotheon builds a wonderfully modern game upon classic Greek tragedy.;Dan Starkey has always been enamored with Greek myth. He spent ten hours battling his favorite gods and goddesses for the sake of this review.
Raven's Cry Review;1;Abysmal; A game where its most tolerable moments are tedious at best, Raven's Cry is a shipwreck of poor decisions and atrocious execution.;Don doesn't mind being a pirate in video games, but he probably wouldn't want to be one in real life just cause of the puffy shirts alone. He spent 17 hours with Raven's Cry before a game-killing bug forced him to stop.
The Order: 1886 Review;5;Mediocre; The Order: 1886 is a boring collection of game cliches that betrays its fascinating premise.;Kevin VanOrd has rarely met a game set in Victorian London he didn't like, but The Order: 1886 has proven to be the exception. It took him six hours to finish The Order, playing some at medium difficulty and some on hard, and he has no desire to return to it.
#IDARB Review;8;Great; #IDARB combines the interactivity of Twitch Plays Pokemon with simple, raw competition.;Tyler Hicks has yet to drop a game of #IDARB in matchmaking, and has even been known to school professional gamers in the intricacies of the 5-point shot. For this review he completed the single player campaign and went on a reign of terror in matchmaking as Divekick's Mr. N.
The Escapists Review;8;Great; The Escapists is a thrilling game that challenges you to break out of prison in a number of different ways.;Cameron Woolsey believes he‰Ûªs too pretty to survive in prison, but feels he‰Ûªs somewhat more prepared after playing The Escapist (he‰Ûªs most likely incorrect.) In this review, Cameron spent more than 50 hours completing the six primary prisons, and feels excited to return to finish off the bonus ones soon.
Evolve Review;8;Great; Evolve is a tense and gratifying online shooter.;Kevin VanOrd spent a good 30 hours with Evolve, playing with strangers, friends, and bots via matchmaking and invite both. His favorite online shooter is still probably Battlefield 2, though Unreal Tournament 2004 and Half-Life 2 Deathmatch also hold special places in his heart. He'll also patiently explain why Killzone 2's competitive play is awesome to anyone willing to listen. Kevin's favorite Evolve hunter is Parnell, and his favorite monster is the Wraith.
Life is Strange Episode One Review;7;Good; The episodic Life is Strange is off to a good start, featuring sympathetic characters and tense social situations.;Kevin finished the first episode of Life is Strange in about 2 hours, and noticed he missed a few conversation opportunities when the game summarized his choices at the end. He might not be Max's age anymore, but the game made him feel 19 all over again.
Gravity Ghost Review;8;Great; Gravity Ghost combines gorgeous art with haunting themes in a slick physics platformer that is over far too soon.;Don has a soft spot in his heart for well-crafted children's fiction, and Gravity Ghost scratches that itch with aplomb. He spent just over three hours with the game for review.
Blackguards 2 Review;8;Great; Sinister protagonists and smart tactical combat make Blackguards 2 a compelling exercise in evil.;Slaughtering innocents and hanging peasants occupied Brett even more than usual this week, especially during the 20 or so hours he played Blackguards 2.
Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate Review;9;Superb; Do you enjoy murdering wild animals and then wearing their skins as trophies? Everyone needs a hobby, but consider giving it a rest and play this instead.;Sean Bell has spent in excess of 500 hours playing the Monster Hunter series, and once nearly lost his mind hunting the same monster over 30 times in one afternoon.
Switch Galaxy Ultra Review;6;Fair; Switch Galaxy Ultra provides a thrilling sense of speed, but a lack of meaningful incentives dulls the fun.;Don is down for intense arcade racers and has fond memories of wasting too many hours with Audiosurf. He spent over 10 hours with Switch Galaxy Ultra for this review.
Saints Row IV: Gat out of Hell Review;7;Good; Saints Row rides onto new platforms, and a good standalone expansion follows with it.;Justin Clark finished Gat Out Of Hell in just under five hours, with about 69% complete, and an extra hour spent on the loyalty missions after the fact. Mostly, just to keep hanging out with MC Shakespeare.
The Marvellous Miss Take Review;6;Fair; This accessible heist game demands confidence from you, but ultimately short-circuit that aim due to inconsistent AI and dull level design.;Jeremy Signor knows a good stealth game when he plays it, but thirty hours banging his head on the crowded, difficult levels in The Marvellous Miss Take over and over was a bit much. Shame, because it was almost good.
Grim Fandango Remastered Review;8;Great; Grim Fandango remains an absolute delight--funny, good-hearted, and fun to play.;Kevin VanOrd played Grim Fandango in 1998, the year it came out. He was 26. Yes, he's old.
Nosgoth Review;6;Fair; Nosgoth isn‰Ûªt quite what Legacy of Kain fans are looking for, but provides plenty of exciting multiplayer battles starring humans and vampires.;Cameron Woolsey is a huge fan of Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver, the first game he experienced in the series, which he played on his Dreamcast many years ago. While Cameron still holds onto hope that a proper return for Legacy of Kain is in the future, he still enjoyed his time in Nosgoth, but now his neighbors would like him to stop stalking them from the rooftops.
Citizens of Earth Review;7;Good; Citizens of Earth wins hearts and minds, but still loses in a few key states.;"Justin Clark spent many hours meeting and greeting the good people of Crystal City, 30 of which spent seriously hemming and hawing about what to name the vice president before settling on ""V.P. Likeaboss."""
Grey Goo Review;8;Great; Great gameplay and a modern look make Grey Goo an excellent traditional RTS.;Brett got gooey for over 18 hours in the course of writing this review.
Dying Light Review;7;Good; Dying Light has plenty of rewards to offer as long as you're willing to overlook its frustrations.;Kevin VanOrd spent about 40 hours with Dying Light. He was never a fan of the Dead Island games, but he developed a fondness for Dying Light, and absolutely enjoys it more than Dead Island.
Game of Thrones: Episode Two - The Lost Lords Review;8;Great; With the stage setting done, the second episode of Game of Thrones feels like something plucked straight from the source material--gut wrenching, tense, and bloody.;Alexa Ray Corriea always pays her debts. In order to do so, she played through the episode multiple times to explore all choices available to her.
Sunset Overdrive and the Mystery of the Mooil Rig! Review;8;Great; This first return to Sunset City succeeds as a dessert-sampler complement to Insomniac Games‰Ûª 2014 hit.;Going into this assignment, Miguel had completed the main story of Sunset Overdrive and amassed a complete collection of Sunset City smartphones. Miguel took about two hours to complete this expansion‰Ûªs story and another three hours on the side content. As a former Sega fanatic, the comparisons to Jet Set Radio aren‰Ûªt lost on Miguel, though he appreciates both games‰Ûª positive differences as well.
Resident Evil HD Remastered Review;7;Good; Resident Evil HD--a high-definition re-release of a remake of a classic--proves that sometimes the best adventures are the simplest ones.;Kevin VanOrd has played most of the Resident Evil games, and RE4 still remains his favorite. His review of Resident Evil 6 has to this day earned him more ire than any other, but he believes history will be on his side. He played Resident Evil HD twice, once as Jill and once as Chris, but he missed the best ending both times.
Loadout Review;7;Good; Loadout brings its robust weaponcrafting, extreme violence, and goofy sense of humor to the PlayStation 4, and with entertaining results.;Cameron Woolsey is always on the hunt for great free-to-play games, and Loadout is one of his top choices. After crafting 10 weapons, Cameron's favorite is Scorched Earf, a lovely rocket launcher that either sends enemies running, or turns them into piles of ash. They're good friends.
Kalimba Review;7;Good; Kalimba's multitasking isn‰Ûªt as gimmicky as its two-character gameplay premise implies.;Miguel‰Ûªs seasoned (but not encyclopedic) knowledge of side-scrolling platformers was more than enough to tackle all of Kalimba‰Ûªs story mode while his wife helped him with the co-op portion of the game. This complete playthrough--which included a handful of gold totems--makes Miguel wish for a remake of the PlayStation 2 version of The Adventures of Cookie and Cream.
Scrolls Review;7;Good; Scrolls offers new depth to the collectible card genre, but a sluggish endgame robs some of the charm.;Don has played dozens upon dozens of hours of Hearthstone and Magic: The Gathering. He put 30 hours into Scrolls for this review.
Lost Constellation Review;8;Great; Lost Constellation is a brief and unique adventure game with nothing and everything to say, all at once.;"Kevin VanOrd has played Lost Constellation three times now, each time playing out just a little differently than before. He calls his favorite snowman ""Binky."" It's a pet name."
Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth Review;8;Great; Persona Q is a cute and exceptionally enjoyable role-playing game that amplifies the series' humor to great effect.;Heidi got Marie on her first run through the group date cafÌ©, but she was actually trying for Mitsuru. She got Naoto the second time. Maybe they really weren‰Ûªt destined to be. Heidi finished Persona Q in about 75 hours.
World of Warcraft: Warlords of Draenor Review;8;Great; Warlords of Draenor is an exciting look at what it would be like if Draenor was never ripped asunder by the corruption of the Burning Legion.;Brittany Vincent, Lady of War, has been an on-again, off-again (definitely on-again now) WoW player since its inception. She spent more than 35 hours in-game prior to this review and hopes to quadruple that amount in the near future.
Tropico 5: Waterborne Review;5;Mediocre; Giving El Presidente water wings in this gimmicky and skimpy expansion to Tropico 5 doesn‰Ûªt add much to the franchise‰Ûªs familiar Caribbean corruption.;Corrupting the hearts and minds of Tropico 5's peasants was at the top of Brett‰Ûªs priority list for around eight hours while he was reviewing the Waterborne expansion.
The Talos Principle Review;9;Superb; Excellent puzzles are only the tip of the iceberg for The Talos Principle, an existential journey about what it is to be human.;Jeremy Signor reasoned his way through forty hours of The Talos Principle, and after completing dozens of puzzle rooms, is pretty sure he needs a puzzle break.
Destiny: The Dark Below Review;6;Fair; Destiny gets darker with its new add-on, but the game itself isn't better for it.;Not counting grind time, Justin Clark was able to get through the new Dark Below content in about five hours, spent many more with the Crota's End raid, and one quiet hour lounging on top of a bus in Skywatch contemplating the meaning of life before Urzok went and spoiled it for everybody.
Shadows: Heretic Kingdoms Review;7;Good; Shadows: Heretic Kingdoms has fresh ideas, but needs more time to develop everything else.;Brandin Tyrrel spent 30 hours marching through the Heretic Kingdoms with multiple starting characters despite the main quest line requiring only a third of that. Slaying the Lords of Hell in Diablo II remains his favorite hack-and-slash memory, though Titan Quest and Torchlight are not far behind.
Elegy for a Dead World Review;7;Good; Elegy for a Dead World is an intriguing and attractive creation tool that fills a highly specific, highly underserved niche.;Kevin VanOrd spent about eight hours with Elegy for a Dead World, writing and reading stories until his creative well went dry and was filled again.
Secret Ponchos Review;7;Good; Secret Ponchos exudes depth despite its limited features.;Miguel‰Ûªs review is based on a 101 matches where he boasts a respectable 40% win percentage, including Free For All matches (where he had five 1st place wins). His favorite Westerns include Once Upon A Time In The West, Unforgiven, and Tombstone.
Assassin's Creed Unity: Dead Kings Review;5;Mediocre; The now-free downloadable content for Assassin‰Ûªs Creed Unity kicks off with a passable new chapter that is neither a conclusion nor epilogue.;Going into Dead Kings, Miguel had already become familiar with Ubisoft‰Ûªs vision of Paris after about 20 hours in Assassin‰Ûªs Creed Unity. (That included a 100-percent sychronization playthrough of the story.) Dead Kings served as a reminder that Miguel dislikes playing a gofer in open world storylines.
Kingdom Hearts 2.5 HD 2.5 ReMIX Review;7;Good; Ten years later, Kingdom Hearts' stories suffer under preposterous complexity, but a refreshing heart still shines through.;Don can remember eagerly awaiting the first Kingdom Hearts game's release when he was in middle school. He put 37 hours into Kingdom Hearts 2, 27 hours into Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, and 3 hours with Re:Coded.
JuJu Review;6;Fair; Juju reaches valiantly for magic and finds out that someone broke the staff.;Jason Venter has played through so many platformers that they've started to form a rainbow mass in his brain, but he happily spent several mostly relaxing hours bopping his way through the worlds featured in Juju for the purposes of this review.
The Crew Review;5;Mediocre; The Crew has a lot of missions and environments to explore, but there are myriad issues that get in the way of its positive aspects.;For the majority of his time with The Crew, Peter played on his own with the same car. He only explored other options in the game because they were available, but quickly realized that playing with a crew and upgrading other cars simply wasn't with the effort.
Tetris Ultimate Review;7;Good;" It‰Ûªs a fine version of a classic, but there's little that's ""ultimate"" about Tetris Ultimate.";Britton Peele has been staying up past his bedtime playing Tetris since the days of the original Game Boy. He conquered Tetris Ultimate's marathon mode, played against more than 10 online opponents and spent some time with local multiplayer before writing this review.
Limbo Review;8;Great; The mystery and moodiness of Limbo remain beautifully intact on its new platform.;Kevin played Limbo twice upon its initial release on the Xbox 360, and once more on the Xbox One for the purposes of this review. It took him about two hours this time around, in part because he got stuck on one of the late puzzles.
Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy Review;7;Good; Phoenix Wright's first three adventures return on the 3DS, prettier but not better than ever.;Justin Clark played the first two games in this compilation to death on the original DS, though this was his first full playthrough of the third. This is now the 5th time in a decade he has had to explain to someone out in the real world what exactly he was objecting to so vehemently in public.
Geometry Wars 3: Dimensions Review;8;Great; Geometry Wars 3 is yet another great game in this dual-stick series that will leave your brain buzzing and your fingers numb.;Kevin VanOrd played dozens of hours of Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved, and possibly hundreds of hours of its sequel. He's played about 20 hours of Geometry Wars 3, and suspects his playtime will reach the hundred-hour mark before the year ends.
Defenders of Time Review;7;Good; Defenders of Time is an exciting tower defense game that no one's playing, making it difficult to actually enjoy its fast-paced action.;Josiah Renaudin isn't exactly a strategic mastermind, but he still enjoys testing his wits against other players online. For the purposes of this review, he played each of the six maps multiple times and even tried to lead a handful of teams as the Commander.
Tales from the Borderlands: Episode One - Zer0 Sum Review;9;Superb; Tales from the Borderlands is a beautiful new twist on the Borderlands experience with lovable leads and breathless action sequences.;Alexa Ray Corriea is excited to return to Pandora under Telltale‰Ûªs guidance. She loves shooting and looting with her Mechromancer, but may love manipulating narratives to suit her whims even more.
Game of Thrones: Episode One - Iron From Ice Review;8;Great; Game of Thrones‰Ûª first episode is a slow-burn beginning to a bloody political thriller with an original cast that shines.;Alexa Ray Corriea is the absolute worst about accidentally dropping Game of Thrones spoilers because she gets too excited and can‰Ûªt help herself. Don't talk to her.
Super Smash Bros. for Wii U Review;9;Superb; Super Smash Bros. for Wii U is among the best fighting games ever made.;Dan Starkey can‰Ûªt remember a time when he wasn‰Ûªt playing Smash Bros. on a semi-regular basis. He met his best friend through Smash, he‰Ûªs got entire groups of friends that get together just to chat and play Smash Bros. He feels lucky to have spent around 90 hours so far with a game this superb, holding a Smash party, playing against the CPU, and competing online when he was lucky enough to enter a smooth match.
Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker Review;8;Great; Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker is bound to warm your heart and challenge your intellect.;Peter played through the entire game, minus a few bonus levels, while enjoying his time in the Toads' shoes, and for the first time with a Wii U game, he preferred to play on the GamePad instead of the TV.
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth Review;8;Great; More weirdness, more blasphemy, and more great action makes this remake of The Binding of Isaac spectacularly absorbing.;Brett Todd confronted poo in all of its insidious guises for about seven hours in the course of writing this The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth review.
Never Alone Review;4;Poor; Upper One Games succeeds at bringing Native Alaskan cultural heritage to the fore, but fails at making a good platformer.;Being Australian, Daniel has no idea what snow looks like, but after completing the game in just over four hours in a mixture of singleplayer and co-op, and watching all the Cultural Insights vignettes, he has a sudden desire to travel somewhere far north.
Space Hulk: Ascension Edition Review;7;Good; A broader focus makes this Space Hulk sequel a better experience despite its brutal difficulty.;Brett Todd flamed Genestealers for about 15 hours while reviewing Space Hulk: Ascension.
How To Survive: Storm Warning Edition Review;7;Good; How to Survive returns in a fun but unimaginative compilation edition.;It took about ten hours for Miguel to go through every mode of How To Survive: Storm Warning Edition, playing every section on Normal difficulty. He‰Ûªs played his share of zombie-themed games though he‰Ûªs not what one would call a zombie enthusiast. Unlike some, he doesn‰Ûªt believe there such a thing as too many (good) zombie games.
Escape Dead Island Review;5;Mediocre; Escape Dead Island is a competent yet unremarkable side story with remarkably shallow action.;Miguel‰Ûªs 30-hour playthrough of the original Dead Island was the most time he has ever spent on a zombie game. Between the PC version, a completed playthrough of the PlayStation 3 version, and a sufficient look at the New Game+ mode, Miguel spent 15 hours in Escape Dead Island. This marks his fourth review game in a row that features a jungle. He now longs for a vast dense city or a fire level.
Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham Review;7;Good; Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham celebrates the history of Batman while offering loads of extra content.;Cameron Woolsey, a fan of Lego and Batman for many years, couldn‰Ûªt decide if he should play Lego Batman 3 first, or build the included Batwing toy set and run it around the house making whooshing noises. Cameron finished the main story in around 15 hours, and spent more than five hours completing side quests and unlocking super heroes.
Lara Croft and the Temple of Osiris Review;7;Good; Lara Croft and the Temple of Osiris is a nice slice of good, lighthearted fun.;Kevin VanOrd has embarked on all sorts of tomb-raiding adventures, so he felt at home with Lara Croft and the Temple of Osiris. He spent six hours with the game, some of them solo, but most of them with at least one other player.
The Wolf Among Us Review;8;Great; Telltale's riff on the Fables series is far from child's play.;Justin Clark has played through The Wolf Among Us twice, first on the PS3, episode by episode, and then on the PS4. He's read the first four compilations of the Fables graphic novels in the interim. For the record, he actually kinda prefers the game to the novels.
Freedom Wars Review;8;Great; Exhilarating missions and a wonderfully versatile grappling hook make Freedom Wars a premiere cooperative experience.;Jeremy Signor loves any and all games with satisfying grappling hook action. He played through the entirety of Freedom Wars' main campaign and dabbled in the postgame and multiplayer modes.
WWE 2K15 Review;5;Mediocre; Although the series' combat has never felt better, WWE 2K15 fails to deliver on the pomp and pageantry of professional wrestling.;Don lost far too many hours playing the PS2-era WWE games at middle school lock-ins. He put roughly 20 hours into the last-gen version of WWE 2K15 and another 13 for the current-gen.
Pokemon Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire Review;8;Great; Pokemon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire resurrect two beloved games in style, and for better or worse, not much has changed.;Peter fell in love with Pokemon years ago, but after a decade hiatus, he jumped back in the saddle for Pokemon X/Y and Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire. He played over 30 hours of Omega Ruby for the purposes of this review, and plans to continue playing until he catches, well, most of them.
Speakeasy Review;3;Bad; The drinks aren't the only thing watered down in Speakeasy.;Justin Clark was able to see all Speakeasy has to offer in an hour, though that hour ultimately stretched into several more.
Little Big Planet 3 Review;7;Good; Little Big Planet 3‰Ûªs focus on creative expression is underutilized in its story campaign but shines in its level editor.;Alexa Ray Corriea has been BFFs with Sackboy since his debut in 2008 and still can‰Ûªt get enough of those sweet, sweet prize bubbles. She played the entire story campaign and spent an inordinate amount of time building stuff.
Adventure Time: The Secret of the Nameless Kingdom Review;6;Fair; The Secret of the Nameless Kingdom is an unabashed if uninspired Zelda clone.;Josiah Renaudin loves the classic Legend of Zelda formula, even when it‰Ûªs dressed up as an Adventure Time game. For the purposes of this review, he watched many episodes of the TV show and saved the different princesses in The Secret of the Nameless Kingdom.
Rollers of the Realm Review;4;Poor; Rollers of the Realm is a good idea let down by its execution.;Jason Venter has enjoyed a video pinball game or two on very nearly every system he has ever played, and more RPGs than he would care to count, so he was doubly disappointed when the several hours he spent with Rollers of the Realm failed to do justice to either genre.
Randal's Monday Review;4;Poor; Randal's Monday's strict adherence to bad design and unpleasant humor makes this one Monday you don't want to relive.;Jeremy Signor spent over 20 hours puzzling over the nonsense in this game, even after breaking down and consulting the hint system numerous times.
This War of Mine Review;8;Great; This War of Mine is survival horror game of a very different, very literal kind.;Justin Clark went through This War of Mine with 5 separate groups of survivors, never making it more than a month. The longest survivor was a coffee drinking journalist named Katia. She killed herself after her last companion died on a scavenge. Justin then spent the rest of the evening watching Looney Tunes and cuddling his cat.
Grand Theft Auto 5 PS4/Xbox One/PC Review;9;Superb; GTA V remains a benchmark game, and its graphical improvements are hugely impressive, but it's the addition of a first-person mode that transforms it into a very different beast.;In the 90s Mark bought a 3DFX card for his PC just so he could play the original Grand Theft Auto in all its high(ish) resolution glory. He has played every game in the series since, including the entirety of the original release of GTA V. For this new version Mark made his way through a hefty chunk of the campaign, and jumped online to take on jobs and rampages around Los Santos.
Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric Review;2;Terrible; Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric is another plummet in the sad decline of the Sonic franchise.;Sonic the Hedgehog was, alongside the Sega Genesis version of Aladdin, one of the first video games Don ever owned. Beating Rise of Lyric took him roughly 11 hours.
Halo: The Master Chief Collection Review;6;Fair; The Master Chief Collection's four campaigns are evergreen, but serious problems with online multiplayer are a blight on this compilation.;A fan of Halo since its Macworld unveiling, Chris has played countless hours of Halo over the years. For this review, he played sizable chunks of each campaign using code provided by Microsoft. Once servers went live, he spent he better part of three days trying to get into online matches.
Assassin's Creed Rogue Review;6;Fair; Despite some intriguing Abstergo revelations, Assassin's Creed Rogue is a uninspired and only mildly entertaining adventure.;After being a little disappointed with Assassin's Creed Unity, Mark was hoping Rogue might renew his faith in the franchise. Oh, how wrong he was.
Dragon Age: Inquisition Review;9;Superb; With the entertaining and thematically rich Inquisition, the Dragon Age series returns to its former glory.;Kevin VanOrd has played every major Dragon Age release. (Admittedly, he's never touched a Dragon Age on mobile platforms, or on Facebook.) His favorite party member in the series is Varric. He does not miss his previous Dragon Age love interest, Anders. (That jerk!) He spent 85 hours on the campaign, and several more in multiplayer. He played on Xbox One and PlayStation 4
Assassin's Creed Unity Review;7;Good; Assassin's Creed Unity's recreation of a battle-scarred Paris is a joy to behold, but its so-so story doesn't make the most of this gorgeous setting.;Mark has been a member of the brotherhood since Assassin's Creed II, but prefers to forget about ACIII. For the purposes of this review he completed the single-player, indulged in some co-op, and played through a good chunk of Unity's side quests.
WWE 2K15 Review;4;Poor; WWE 2K15's last-gen outing is a sad afterthought at the end of a console era.;Don Saas would love to talk to you about how Seth Rollins and Dolph Ziggler should headline this year's Wrestlemania in an Iron Man match but knows it won't happen. He spent roughly 20 hours in the game for this review.
Far Cry 4 Review;7;Good; Far Cry 4 is all about more: more fun things to do, more chances to create explosive chaos, and more opportunities for the story to make you cringe.;Kevin VanOrd has played every Far Cry game, beginning with the original PC classic. He thinks Blood Dragon might still be his favorite Far Cry experience, though he has liked every entry in its own way. He spent about 25 hours with Far Cry 4 in all, playing solo, cooperatively, and competitively.
Ultimate NES Remix Review;7;Good; The NES Remix series finds the perfect home on 3DS.;Mark's first console was a NES, which came boxed with a copy of Super Mario Bros. It was the best Christmas ever. He's managed to three star his way through most of NES Remix's challenges, but remains confused by Balloon Fight.
NBA Live 15 Review;5;Mediocre; NBA Live 15 is a step in the right direction, but that still doesn‰Ûªt make it a good basketball game.;Josiah Renaudin watches more basketball than he cares to admit, and plays just about everything carrying the NBA name each year. For the purposes of this review, he slogged his way through NBA Live 15‰Ûªs Rising Star mode, played multiple offline and online games, and explored the Dynasty feature.
Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare Review;8;Great; Sledgehammer Games lays the groundwork for more futuristic Call of Duty games with a comprehensive multiplayer experience and a faulty but stimulating campaign.;As a veteran of every mainline Call of Duty campaign, it took Miguel seven hours and change to complete Advanced Warfare‰Ûªs campaign on Hardened mode. He then spent approximately 25 hours combined on the adversarial multiplayer and co-op modes. He just might plan a trip to the real life version of Seoul, South Korea.
A Bird Story Review;8;Great; A Bird Story is a short but bittersweet tale that uses sparse interaction to great effect.;Justin Clark was able to clear A Bird Story in an hour. He promptly placed a phone call to his landlord about all the unexpected dust in his apartment getting into his eyes.
Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers 20th Anniversary Edition Review;6;Fair; Gabriel Knight returns with a modern twist, bringing with him the good and the bad.;Brandin Tyrrel maneuvered Gabriel Knight through 16 hours of murder, mystery, and melodrama, though he regularly stopped to smell the roses. His favorite point-and-click adventure series is still King‰Ûªs Quest.
Planetary Annihilation Review;7;Good; It may be souped-up fast and super tough, but Planetary Annihilation still hooks you with intense combat and brilliant enemy AI.;Brett Todd enjoyed but generally failed to keep up with Planetary Annihilation for about 14 hours in the course of writing this review.
Pro Evolution Soccer 2015 Review;8;Great; PES 2015 is a genuine return to form for the series, one that competes with FIFA on every step, pass, and shot.;A sports game obsessive, John has been hooked on football games since he was a mere eight years old. He is now significantly older than that. Many trophies were won and lost across the 15 hours spent playing PES 2015 for the purposes of this review, but more finals beckon in future. You might see him playing online as AS Roma.
Football Manager 2015 Review;8;Great; Football Manager 2015 is the same game we've come to know and love, but in this case that's no bad thing.;John Robertson has 18 years experience playing Football Manager, stretching back to when it was known as Championship Manager and Eric Cantona was considered a star signing. After failing with Dagenham and Redbridge, he started a new game and won the triple with Real Madrid. Glory hunter.
Depth Review;5;Mediocre; Depth's underwater twist on a familiar design comes up all wet.;Cameron Woolsey is not an experienced diver or shark expert, and if he ever finds himself underwater in a shark cage, he will be happy to keep the door closed. But if he ever decides to go explore an undersea cave for treasure, he feels that Depth taught him enough to survive the experience. So long as someone else goes first.
Dungeon of the Endless Review;7;Good; Dungeon of the Endless blends many different gameplay styles into a satisfying dungeon crawler.;Cameron Woolsey enjoys a good dungeon crawler, and Dungeon of the Endless quickly became one of his favorites. For the purpose of the review, Cameron spent more than 20 hours playing the game both online and off, unlocking a dozen characters in the process.
The Unfinished Swan Review;8;Great; The Unfinished Swan on the PlayStation 4 is a pretty game made prettier, and a gentle charmer in its own right.;Justin Clark spent three hours on The Unfinished Swan, 20 minutes of which were spent looking at the giant white labyrinth halfway through while humming appropriate David Bowie tunes.
Lords of the Fallen Review;8;Great; Satisfying combat and a darkly beautiful, interconnected kingdom make Lords of the Fallen more than just a clone.;Kevin VanOrd has played Demon's Souls, Dark Souls, and Dark Souls II, so he was right at home with Lords of the Fallen. He spent over 20 hours with Lords of the Fallen and just started a new-game-plus, which is proving to be an even richer experience than the initial run.
Neverending Nightmares Review;7;Good; Neverending Nightmares is an apt name for an unnerving but meandering experience.;Justin Clark spent two hours on Neverending Nightmares, and managed to personally earn two of the endings.
Civilization: Beyond Earth Review;7;Good; Civilization: Beyond Earth's brave new world feels pretty familiar, but that's okay.;Nick Capozzoli spent hundreds of hours with Civilization V, and a couple dozen hours with Civilization: Beyond Earth, with hundreds more still clearly in store.
Minecraft Xbox One Edition Review;9;Superb; Minecraft: Xbox One Edition lays the foundation for incredible constructions and grand adventures, both large and small.;Cameron Woolsey feels that the best Minecraft has to offer is not only in massive structures, but with the smaller things. Cameron has spent dozens of hours scouring caves and forests for materials, but some of his favorite moments include watching the sun fall on a distant horizon, and peering into awe-inspiring crevasses where water and lava flow free.
Legend of Grimrock 2 Review;9;Superb; Legend of Grimrock II is another fantastic trip to the grid.;Brandin Tyrrel has loved grid-based dungeon crawlers since he played his SNES copy of Eye of the Beholder. He spent 30 hours plundering Grimrock II, took 58,000 steps, and turned into a bear once. His party was level 15 when he finally shut it down, and he still hadn't found every secret.
Sunset Overdrive Review;8;Great; Sunset Overdrive doesn't take itself too seriously, and it's bursting at the seams with colorful action and creativity.;Peter blasted his way through the main mission path, taking the time to dabble in side missions and multiplayer matches along the way.
Skylanders Trap Team Review;8;Great; Fun villains and a joyful campaign make Trap Team another delightful entry into the Skylanders series.;Randolph played through the main campaign of Skylanders Trap team twice--once going solo, and once with his five-year old son.
Fairy Fencer F Review;5;Mediocre; Heidi is a huge fan of JRPGs, and is always eager to see new entries in the genre get localized and released in the West. While Fairy Fencer F was ...;There are glimpses of fun times in Fairy Fencer F, but they‰Ûªre buried under irritating characters and confounding technical issues.
Dreamfall Chapters Book One: Reborn Review;7;Good; Dreamfall Chapters' first entry isn't wholly satisfying on its own, but it lays a great and characterful foundation for the episodes to come.;Kevin VanOrd's favorite game of all time is The Longest Journey. He has spent countless hours devising theories related to The Six, The Prophet, and the Dreamtime. He sometimes talks like the character Abnaxus just for the fun of it. It took him three hours or so to finish Dreamfall Chapters' first episode. Full disclosure: Kevin contributed $25 to Dreamfall Chapters' Kickstarter fund.
TRI: Of Friendship and Madness Review;8;Great; TRI: Of Friendship and Madness redefines the first-person puzzler through creative simplicity.;Brandin Tyrrel never thought he would find another first-person puzzle game as engaging as Portal. Yet, as he discovered over a dozen hours with TRI: Of Friendship and Madness, mind-bending mechanics and smartly designed puzzles are alive and well.
A City Sleeps Review;5;Mediocre; A City Sleeps is a great looking shooter with compelling mechanics, but it suffers under the weight of its ambitions and prohibitive difficulty.;Peter cut his teeth on Gradius and R-Type growing up, and has had a fondness for shoot-em-ups ever since. He made it through six stages in A City Sleeps before hitting a wall.
Falling Skies: The Game Review;4;Poor; Falling Skies is a functional, unattractive, and uninspired XCOM clone.;Justin Clark spent about seven hours with Falling Skies: The Game, another two-and-a-half giving the TV show another shot, an hour looking up what happened to that show where Jason Lee was a cop in Memphis, and another 15 minutes being sad it got cancelled after one season.
Fluster Cluck Review;3;Bad; This top-down arena shooter runs afoul of fun.;Miguel needed five unfortunate hours to clear Fluster Cluck's single-player mode and managed to convince three friends to suffer with him for two hours on couch multiplayer. His most recent meal at KFC was delicious.
F1 2014 Review;6;Fair; F1 2014 does little different to last year's game, but fans will dig the great handling and new season of cars.;Alex Goy is the Cars Editor of sister site XCAR.com and a huge F1 Fan. He's lost many hours to racing around all manner of wobbly circles over the years, both on the track and in front a TV. Alex spent around 24 hours hammering the most out of F1 2014 for the purposes of this review.
The Legend of Korra Review;3;Bad; The Legend of Korra doesn't even come close to capturing the spark of the universe it depicts.;Kevin has seen every episode of Avatar: The Last Airbender, every episode of The Legend of Korra that has aired as of this article, and even the awful Last Airbender film. He finished The Legend of Korra (the game, that is) in a single sitting, and has dabbled in the pro-bending mode and additional difficulty level that are unlocked once the story is complete.
Disney Fantasia: Music Evolved Review;8;Great; Fantasia is an excellent and joyful game that turns rhythm gameplay into performance art.;Kevin VanOrd went to the Oberlin Conservatory to study violin performance and composition, and he's seen the films Fantasia and Fantasia 2000 more times than he can count. His favorite film vignette is Rhapsody in Blue from Fantasia 2000
Costume Quest 2 Review;7;Good; Costume Quest 2 is a charming sequel that fixes most of its predecessor's flaws, though it remains a very short, overly simple experience.;Justin is a senior editor at GameSpot. He spent about six hours wandering through Costume Quest's world collecting candy and costumes. Halloween is his favorite holiday, and dentists freak him out a little.
Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition Review;8;Great; One of the best games of 2012 gets a mild makeover.;Miguel fondly recalls the holidays of 2012 as the time he reached 100-percent completion in Sleeping Dogs. Miguel spent 15 hours on the Definitive Edition and found this review assignment as a fine opportunity to finally complete the two post-release downloadable stories. It‰Ûªs games like Sleeping Dogs and Yakuza that make Miguel want Shenmue 3 less and less.
Hack 'n' Slash Review;6;Fair; Hack 'n' Slash's puzzles esoteric puzzles are alternately delightful and discouraging.;Daniel spent roughly eight hours sticking his sword into every in-game USB port he could find and fiddling with the variables. He was unable to find all of the endgame secrets, because he is not John Carmack.
The Evil Within Review;7;Good; The Evil Within is a captivating return to the glory days of survival horror whose various issues keep it just short of greatness.;Shaun McInnis has a long history with survival horror and counts Resident Evil Code Veronica on the Dreamcast as his favorite game in the genre. He completed The Evil Within on PS4 in just under 20 hours and fully intends to play some more on New Game Plus.
Sherlock Holmes: Crimes & Punishments Review;8;Great; All-new game mechanics, first-rate graphics, and involved sleuthing make Sherlock Holmes: Crimes & Punishments a great adventure game.;"Brett Todd repeated ""Elementary, my dear Watson"" over and over to himself through the 20+ hours he spent playing Sherlock Holmes: Crimes & Punishments."
Styx: Master of Shadows Review;5;Mediocre; Clunky combat, bad AI, and so-so stealth leave Styx lingering in the shadows of mediocrity.;Britton Peele has crept through the shadows with Metal Gear Solid and Splinter Cell, but his more modern stealth favorites are Dishonored and Mark of the Ninja. He took 20 hours to complete Styx's story, finished many of the side-objectives, and replayed a few sections on different difficulty levels.
Fantasy Life Review;6;Fair; Fantasy Life is an ambitious but repetitive RPG that makes fails to make the mundane magical.;Aoife, as a mercenary wordsmith, crack-shot and frequent slayer of demons, found that cooking the perfect fish stew and knitting a pair of fancy mittens were easily the most fantastical things she's done in a game for a very, very long time. She'll stick with just ordering take-out next time, thank you very much.
NBA 2K15 Review;9;Superb; NBA 2K15‰Ûªs overhauled movement system and improved shooting mechanics make it the best-playing basketball game in existence.;Josiah Renaudin is a basketball fanatic who loves watching the NBA, but always manages to hurt himself during pick-up games. He played hundreds of hours of NBA 2K14, dozens of hours of 2K15‰Ûªs many game modes, and won a championship with his custom small forward in MyCareer.
Persona 4 Arena Ultimax Review;8;Great; Persona 4 Ultimax is a worthy upgrade to a solid fighter, with plenty of new content for competitive players and Persona fans alike.;Heidi‰Ûªs been fervently playing--and reviewing--the Persona titles for many years now. While she‰Ûªs a little bit sad that P4AU‰Ûªs story mode wasn‰Ûªt quite as good as hoped, she also appreciates how it wraps up a lot of the various character stories. Bring on Persona 5!
Short Peace: Ranko Tsukigime's Longest Day Review;6;Fair; Short Peace's four animated shorts are wonderful examples of modern animation, but the game portion, Ranko Tsukigime's Longest Day, is a letdown on almost every front.;Peter's sampled the world of anime over the course of the last 20 years, and Katsuhiro Otomo is one of his favorite artists. He played through Ranko Tsukigime's Longest Day twice for this review just to make sure he didn't miss anything that would have characterized it as anything better than mediocre.
Driveclub Review;5;Mediocre; Driveclub is a solid, basic racing game with lots of tracks, lots of cars, and very little in the way of personality.;Kevin completed Driveclub's single-player tour, led his club to level 17, and participated in all sorts of challenges and races.
Dark Souls II: Crown of the Ivory King Review;9;Superb; Dark Souls II, in all its epic designs, fittingly concludes in the harshness of winter.;By Dark Souls II's stats, Miguel is just a couple hours short of passing 250 hours in his entire playthrough, including all DLCs. With Crown of the Ivory King complete, he has officially stuck a fork in Dark Souls II. He won't weep, for there are still other worlds to conquer--just not in this game.
Watch Dogs: Bad Blood Review;8;Great; A finely-made Watch Dogs quasi-epilogue finds a new playable protagonist struggling to tie loose ends;Miguel has probably played more Watch Dogs than most of those who bought Watch Dogs, so he was more than ready to take on Bad Blood. After completing this campaign, a handful of optional content was the break Miguel needed before diving head first into the holiday season.
Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel Review;7;Good; Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel brings you more of the loot and lighthearted humor you love, though it never quite overcomes the gravity of its predecessors.;Cameron Woolsey is a longtime fan of shooting and looting, and has spent an embarrassing amount of hours taking out enemies and rifling through treasure chests on the hunt for shiny things. Cameron spent about 45 hours on Pandora‰Ûªs moon. There, he completed the story and nearly every side quest, and defeated the raid boss as the mighty Claptrap, reaching level 33. He also played as Wilhelm for about 10 of those hours.
Endless Legend Review;8;Great; Endless Legend adds fantastic twists to familiar strategy.;Brandin Tyrrel has invested untold hours into turn-based strategy endeavors. He enjoyed the 35 he spent reviewing Endless Legend, and the promise of each unique faction. He'll soon start the most massive campaign he can, before getting distracted and finishing it up 2-3 years from now, like he always does.
Kraven Manor Review;6;Fair; It's scary and has some great ideas, but Kraven Manor doesn't live up to its potential.;Britton Peele is too much of a coward to go into a haunted house, but he has a great appreciation for great horror games like Amnesia, Fatal Frame and Silent Hill. He completed Kraven Manor twice (once on each difficulty) before writing this review.
Ryse: Son of Rome Review;5;Mediocre; Ryse: Son of Rome is a repetitive and tedious homage to the gruesome battles showcased in the film 300.;Kevin played Ryse: Son of Rome three times on the Xbox One, but only once on the PC. Explaining why that is would require more space than he has here, as well as the help of a neuroscientist.
Super Smash Bros. 3DS Review;8;Great; Smash Bros. is a cavalcade of cartoonish violence and chaos, and it's never been better.;Dan Starkey's been playing Smash Bros. since he was eight years old. He's unlocked every character and stage and almost every trophy in each game. His new main is Pac-Man, and he can't wait to start playing in some local tournaments.
Fenix Rage Review;8;Great; Fenix Rage is sadistic platformer that tests your skills, and, sometimes, your sanity.;Matt appreciates the tough-but-fair challenges offered by Fenix Range and similar thumb-numbing platformers. His wife, who's picked up the pieces of one too many shattered controllers, would rather he just play Lego games with the kids.
The Vanishing of Ethan Carter Review;9;Superb; The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a beautiful adventure that slowly unravels its superficial veneer to reveal a touching and personal story.;As a fan of first-person narrative games like Dear Esther and Gone Home, Shaun was happy to see Ethan Carter turn out so well. He completed the story in six hours, slowly wandering about in order to take in all the scenery. He raced through it a second time in a little over an hour.
Gauntlet Review;6;Fair; An old-fashioned game in a newfangled era, Gauntlet does too much and too little all at once.;Justin Clark spent about 6 hours running the new Gauntlet. Being so very ancient, he has fond memories of playing the original in arcades as a kid, and playing the elf just so he could shoot the food faster than everyone else and laugh at his brother when he died. He was always a lonely child.
Alien: Isolation Review;6;Fair; Alien: Isolation harbors legitimate frights, but they're nestled between endless stretches of bland lever-pulling and button-pressing.;Kevin appreciates the film Aliens, but still prefers the original Alien, and prefers never to think about Prometheus at all. He spent about 16 hours with Alien: Isolation, and he enjoyed them more than the hours he spent with Aliens: Colonial Marines, though that isn't saying much.
Stronghold Crusader 2 Review;6;Fair; Stronghold Crusader 2 brings smart army strategy, but squanders its most interesting asset: the castle.;Jeremy Signor spent over 20 hours playing Stronghold Crusader 2, and came to the realization that he's utterly terrible at it. At least he still can manage to play Starcraft without embarrassing himself.
Spacecom Review;5;Mediocre; Spacecom hovers between minimalist and incomplete.;Nick Capozzoli spent ten hours with Spacecom, mostly being instructed in the finer points of military strategy by better tacticians online. He has a tendency to fall for very basic ploys.
Forza Horizon 2 Review;8;Great; There's a party in Forza Horizon 2, and everyone's invited.;Kevin wishes he reviewed more driving games than he does, and admits to liking the Midwestern setting of the original Horizon a bit more than the pastoral European vistas. He's finished the Horizon Festival finale, but has a lot more to do before he can call himself a Horizon 2 completist.
Five Nights at Freddy's Review;8;Great; Chuck E. Scream.;Justin Clark played through all five nights at Freddy's, over two real nights, after 11 p.m. A sixth night opened up promptly after. The flabbergasted ‰ÛÏnope‰Û he screamed afterwards apparently woke two of his neighbors. He would like to take this time to publicly apologize.
Natural Doctrine Review;4;Poor; Natural Doctrine takes strategy role-playing games one step forward, and several clumsy steps back.;Justin Clark commands legions of people to move in tight, limited squares in real life, too. He's sent thousands of warriors to their screaming deaths in Final Fantasy Tactics, Tactics Ogre, and Jeanne D'Arc over the years, so spending 25-ish hours getting destroyed in single turns by multiple low-level gun-wielding grunts in Natural Doctrine makes for a pretty apt comeuppance, all things considered.
Cannon Brawl Review;6;Fair; Cannon Brawl finds the tools it needs but doesn't know what to do with them.;Jason Venter loves defending castles and destroying them too. For the purposes of this review, he cleared the campaign and kept right on demolishing enemy castles for a few more hours, just because he could.
FIFA 15 Review;8;Great; FIFA 15 might not be wholly realistic, but it brings more flair and excitement than any game in the series so far.;John has been playing FIFA since FIFA '96, a time when hair was bad, Giggs was young and Man City were relegated. For this review John accumulated some 25 hours of match time, finishing fifth in the Premier League with Liverpool and getting fired in the process. He was subsequently offered the Torino job. He rejected it.
Wasteland 2 Review;8;Great; Wasteland 2 is an intricate and triumphant return of a role-playing classic.;Daniel Starkey is enamored with all things post-apocalyptic precisely because they seem to highlight just how silly much of our modern life is. For this review he wandered the wastes for 57 hours over the course of a week.
Neverwinter Updated Review;7;Good; Neverwinter now offers more classes and zones than ever before, but combat still outshines every other aspect.;Leif Johnson spends much of his free time in MMORPGs, and he has two characters at the level cap in Neverwinter. Yes, they're both dwarves. He writes and plays games on a ranch in South Texas.
D4: Dark Dreams Don't Die Review;7;Good; D4 is all kinds of crazy, and you may not take to its unique brand of humor. But if you do, there's no forgetting it.;It took Kevin VanOrd about four hours to finish D4's first installment, and he can't wait to see where the story goes next. He has played another Swery 65 game, Deadly Premonition, three times now. And he doesn't care if you make fun of him for it. So says Mr. Stewart.
Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor Review;8;Great; Shadow of Mordor's political machinations and rambunctious action make it a cut above your everyday Lord of the Rings game.;Kevin VanOrd has read every Lord of the Rings novel, seen every Lord of the Rings movie, and played many Lord of the Rings games, but he recognizes that there are countless Tolkien geeks far more familiar with the universe than he is. He played Shadow of Mordor for about 30 hours, finishing the story and performing countless side missions.
Roundabout Review;8;Great; Roundabout's story is short-lived, but it's jam-packed with humor and crazy, quirky action.;Britton Peele doesn't drive as crazily as the protagonist of Roundabout (a statement his wife might disagree with), but he's always enjoyed living on the zany side of arcade-style driving games. He completed all of Roundabout's story and challenges, then went back for some more collectibles and higher scores before writing this review.
Hatoful Boyfriend Review;7;Good; Hatoful Boyfriend is a bizarre, surprising, and unforgettable journey into the world of literal lovebirds.;
Minecraft: PlayStation 4 Edition Review;9;Superb; Minecraft: PlayStation 4 Edition is a sandbox gem, and one of the best games to own for PlayStation 4.;Cameron Woolsey has traveled the worlds of many sandbox games, but always seems to come back to Minecraft. In his time playing the game on PlayStation 4, he built several houses, traveled to the nether, boated along a snaking river, and accidently set himself on fire about a dozen times.
Murasaki Baby Review;7;Good; Murasaki Baby is a visual treat, even if all the hand-holding detracts from what's taking place on screen.;Josiah Renaudin enjoys a good puzzle game, especially one that tests both his mental and physical reflexes. For the purposes of this review, he helped guide the scared child all the way to the edges of this chilling world.
Minimum Review;6;Fair; Minimum puts a fresh and exciting spin on the online arena.;Cameron Woolsey has competed in online shooting arenas since he first played Quake. He is always ready to delve into an online shooter, and thinks Minimum is worth returning to in spite of its glitches.
Destiny Review;6;Fair; Destiny's essentials are there, and they're great--but the game surrounding them is cold and shallow.;Kevin spent about 40 hours playing Destiny, playing every story mission, every strike mission many times, every competitive match type many many many times, and being glad he had such good friends--and found such nice strangers--to play with.
Hyrule Warriors Review;8;Great; An unlikely pairing of Dynasty Warriors and The Legend Of Zelda yields greatly satisfying results.;Miguel spent approximately 15 hours on Hyrule Warriors, which included mission replays with different characters. Fun fact: Miguel‰Ûªs first 1000-point Xbox 360 Gamerscore was for Dynasty Warriors 6: Empires, though he cannot say the same about Fist of the North Star: Ken‰Ûªs Rage, One Piece: Pirate Warriors, or Dynasty Warriors: Gundam. Regardless, he‰Ûªs hoping Dragon Quest: Heroes gets localized for Western release.
Theatrhythm Final Fantasy: Curtain Call Review;8;Great; Theatrhythm Final Fantasy: Curtain Call is a massive dose of nostalgia for Final Fantasy fans, and even though it's very similar to its predecessor, there are plenty of reasons to ...;Peter has been playing Final Fantasy games for almost twenty years and loved the original Theatrhythm Final Fantasy. During his review, he spent six hours steeped in Curtain Call's massive catalog of music.
Dance Central Spotlight Review;8;Great; Dance Central Spotlight is a lean but thoroughly enjoyably sequel that shifts its focus toward the core dancing experience.;Shaun McInnis' real-life attempts at dancing are generally constrained to weddings and the occasional post-touchdown celebration during Seahawks games. For the purposes of this review, he unlocked most routines on the core selection of songs as well as 10 downloadable songs. He may or may not have gone through three t-shirts in a single day while trying out the cardio routines.
Dead Rising 3: Apocalypse Edition Review;3;Bad; Dead Rising 3 combines bland gameplay and colorful stereotypes into one unfortunate adventure.;Nick Capozzoli played through Dead Rising 3's normal mode and downloadable missions over the course of two weeks. He is afraid of things that wear weird masks, but don't move or speak. Like that dog with the mask in The Unborn. Did anyone see The Unborn? That dog was creepy.
Lichdom: Battlemage Review;6;Fair; Its core combat is sensational, but Lichdom: Battlemage never evolves a proper game around it.;Kevin VanOrd played Lichdom: Battlemage's story from beginning to end and tested himself the combat arenas that unlock once the game is complete. He spent somewhere around 20 hours with Lichdom, but doubts he'll ever return--even if the many spelling mistakes get fixed!
NHL 15 Review;5;Mediocre; New generation graphics and marginal gameplay improvements clash with a lot of missing features in NHL 15.;Brett Todd skated, shot, and slashed the best players in the NHL for over 10 hours while putting together this review of NHL 15.
The Sims 4 Review;6;Fair; The Sims 4 is beautiful and charming, but its constricted structure makes it disappointingly limited.;Kevin VanOrd can't count the number of times he wearily dragged himself to bed at four in the morning while playing the original Sims. He has nurtured two large households over the course of 30 hours or so for this review. He still feels weird having watched the maid walk around his digital sim's dead body while she cleaned the kitchen.
Disney Infinity: Marvel Super Heroes -- 2.0 Edition Review;7;Good; The Toy Box is back and better than ever in Disney Infinity 2.0, and it's still a great way to have a shared gameplay experience with the favorite little child ...;Randolph spent about 14 hours in Disney Infinity Marvel Super Heroes, finishing the Avengers play set and spending quite a bit of time trying to unlock his own creative spark in Toy Box mode. His son Sebastian played, too, but only when he was good and ate all his vegetables.
The Last Tinker: City of Colors Review;5;Mediocre; The Last Tinker‰Ûªs colorful art style isn‰Ûªt enough to overcome its tired mechanics and dreadful framerate.;Josiah Renaudin holds 3D platformers close to his heart. He collected every single banana in Donkey Kong 64, and still thinks Banjo-Kazooie is one of the best games of all time. He hopped, skipped, and jumped his way through the entirety of The Last Tinker, which took about six hours.
Firefall Review;5;Mediocre; Firefall's shooter/MMORPG hybrid combines genres to produce mediocrity.;Nick Capozzoli doesn't have as much time for MMORPGs as he did when he could devote months at a time to turning iron ingots into iron daggers or thinning a virtual world's rat population. He devoted the better part of three weeks to Firefall.
Infamous: First Light Review;6;Fair; Infamous: First Light benefits from Second Son's excellent fundamentals. Its missions and storytelling, however, lack spark.;Kevin VanOrd finished Infamous: Second Son earlier this year. In First Light, he earned diamond-level scores in every battle arena, earned every power, finished the story, and performed every side activity.
Dark Souls 2: Crown of the Old Iron King Review;8;Great; A splendid second DLC for Dark Souls II offers an insightful visual history lesson without saying a word.;Having thoroughly played Dark Souls II, Miguel Concepcion felt that Crown of the Old Iron King was a proverbial old pair of shoes, one that he walked in for an additional ten hours. His appreciation for the history of places and objects hits close to his own home, a townhouse built on the former site of a newspaper publisher.
Azure Striker: Gunvolt Review;8;Great; Gunvolt is an inventive and fast-paced twist on the Mega Man formula that will keep you riveted to your 3DS while the ride lasts.;Peter spent eight hours battling Sumeragi, getting Gunvolt up to level 40, and tackling optional sub-missions during the course of his review. He's played some of every Mega Man series since its debut on the NES, and counts it among his all-time favorite franchises.
Madden NFL 15 Review;7;Good; Madden 15 is a beautiful football game, but its biggest achievement stems from much improved defensive mechanics that make both sides of the ball fun to play.;Josiah Renaudin will be spending each of his Sundays over the next few months glued to his couch, cursing the deficiencies of his fantasy football team. He‰Ûªs been playing Madden since he was a kid, and put time into each of Madden 15‰Ûªs game modes for the purpose of this review.
Velocity 2X Review;9;Superb; Velocity balances platforming and shoot-em-ups as well as modern aesthetics and retro play to create a nearly perfect action experience;"Daniel has mastered the first 26 levels, and hopes to get perfect scores on the remaining 24 soon. For this review he spent about 20 hours over the course of two weeks playing the game on both the Vita and the PS4. He also bugged his friends relentlessly, muttering that the game ""looked like silky butter dripping on [his] eyeballs."""
Metro Redux Review;8;Great; Metro Redux is a terrific package that combines two bleak games into a single cohesive whole.;Kevin VanOrd's favorite game of 2013 was Metro: Last Light, and returning to both it and Metro 2033 was a pleasure. He revisited the original versions of the games in addition to playing these new iterations, spending about 15 hours in total to complete Redux.
Akiba's Trip: Undead and Undressed Review;4;Poor; Even if you can tolerate the inane stripping mechanic, Akiba's Trip does little with its battle system or narrative to warrant your time.;Josiah Renaudin spent most of his childhood maxing out any JRPG that he could get his hands on. He still enjoys exploring some of the most obscure Japanese titles that hit PlayStation consoles, and played Akiba's Trip to completion for the purposes of this review.
The Walking Dead: Season Two Episode Five ‰ÛÒ No Going Back Review;7;Good; A brutal showdown and zombies on ice mark the final, oddly slow-paced, episode of season two of The Walking Dead.;Brett Todd hung out with Clementine and pals for a little over five hours while twice playing through this final episode of season two of The Walking Dead.
Might and Magic Duel of Champions: Forgotten Wars Review;7;Good; Duel of Champions is the most epic card game you've already played.;Jeremy Signor knows a bit about card games thanks to the countless hours he's spent on Magic: The Gathering, dabbling in any competitive CCG that comes out, and generally immersing himself in tabletop games. Jeremy spent ten hours completing the main campaign for this review and played many ranked matches online.
Surgeon Simulator: Anniversary Edition Review;4;Poor; The PS4 port of the hilariously macabre PC game could do with a few operations of its own.;To give you an idea of the difference in control schemes, Daniel Hindes completed the opening heart transplant on PC on his first go, but it took him over two hours on the PS4. For playtime, multiply that by how long you find that funny.
The Golf Club Review;6;Fair; Golf returns to the PC with The Golf Club, a rigorous simulation that falls just short of the green.;Frequent golfer Brett Todd hacked away for about 12 hours in the course of writing this review of The Golf Club.
CounterSpy Review;8;Great; CounterSpy is short, but its stylized presentation and alluring gameplay hooks make it too sweet to pass up.;Josiah Renaudin tends to shoot first and ask questions later when he plays games, but he at least tries to sneak through levels when the opportunities present themselves. For the purpose of this review, he played CounterSpy to completion and saved the moon.
Shadowgate Review;7;Good; It doesn't move the genre forward in any way, but Shadowgate is a wonderful return to the early days of adventuring.;Britton Peele took his first step into the castle with Shadowgate Classic on the Game Boy Color, which kept him up way too late for many nights afterward. He took a couple thousand turns to beat the new Shadowgate and spent some time with the various difficulty levels before writing this review.
Hohokum Review;7;Good; The lack of direction can lead to repeated frustrations, but the striking visuals and hypnotic character movement make Hohokum a joy.;Josiah Renaudin probably works too much, so he can appreciate a game all about relaxation. He‰Ûªs enjoyed ‰ÛÏart‰Û games like Journey and Flower in the past, and completed all 17 worlds of Hohokum during the review process.
Sacred 3 Review;4;Poor; Tedium is at the heart of Sacred 3, a successor to the earlier games in the series in name only.;Brett Todd spent about 14 hours mindlessly mashing his mouse in Sacred 3 for this review.
Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair Review;8;Great; Memorable characters, sharp writing and engaging mystery-solving gameplay make this deadly island adventure a trip to remember.;Heidi loves Japanese story-driven games, and both Danganronpa games have been among her favorite gaming experiences in recent years. She also feels the need to warn people that even typing Danganronpa related terms into Google search can result in spoilers, as a character's fate was autofilled into the search box when just trying to find info on a voice actor. Argh!
Diablo 3: Ultimate Evil Edition Review;9;Superb; Console owners reap the benefits of two years worth of changes and updates in this conclusive version of Diablo III.;Miguel spent the better part of this week in Diablo‰Ûªs world of Sanctuary on the PS4 and Xbox One, clearing the campaign‰Ûªs five acts and several Adventure Mode quests.
Mind: Path to Thalamus Review;7;Good; The Path to Thalamus is not free of bumps, but the journey should be taken, if only because the sights are so vivid.;Kevin VanOrd spent about four hours puzzling over Path to Thalamus and drinking in its scenery.
Risen 3: Titan Lords Review;7;Good; Like it's predecessors, Risen 3 provides a rollicking adventure that doesn't quite deliver on the details.;Kevin VanOrd played all three Risen games. It took him about 35 hours or so to finish Risen 3, during which time he aligned with the demon hunters, collected all but one buried treasure, and helped Patty work her wiles on all of her targets.
Road Not Taken Review;7;Good; Road Not Taken treads an unconventional trail, and is mostly better for it.;Jason Venter has been playing and enjoying puzzle and adventure games for most of his life, so spending another 20 or so hours with Road Not Taken for the purposes of this review suited him just fine.
Only If Review;2;Terrible; Its conclusion may be putrid, but Only If's primary redeeming feature is that it does eventually end.;Kevin VanOrd is no stranger to story-driven mysteries, but he wishes he'd never unearthed this one. He spent about five hours with Only If--enough time to have played it thrice.
The Walking Dead: Season Two Episode Four - Amid the Ruins Review;9;Superb; Clementine is no longer a spectator in Amid the Ruins, the action-packed latest episode in season two of The Walking Dead.;Brett Todd spent about two hours contemplating the futility of human existence while not coincidentally playing Amid the Ruins for this review.
Magic the Gathering - Duels of the Planeswalkers 2015 Review;6;Fair; Magic 2015 gives you fewer reasons to love a fantastic game.;Jeremy Signor started playing Magic: The Gathering ten years ago and got back into the game with Magic 2012. He played Magic 2015 for 13 hours, getting through the main campaign, playing online matches, and browsing the in-game store.
Halfway Review;7;Good; Halfway is an emotional tale of mystery and survival that occasionally lacks the courage of its own convictions.;Dan Starkey is a huge fan of classic, slow-paced science fiction, with Alien and Blade Runner at the top of his list of favorite films. He hoped Halfway would live up to the pedigree of its inspirations.
Wii Sports Club Review;6;Fair; This repackaging of the classic Wii Sports drops the ball when it comes to connectivity.;Wii Sports is the only game that practically everybody in Heidi Kemps' large extended family has played. She was eager to see if Wii Sports Club would forge that same connection. Alas...
Metrico Review;6;Fair; Metrico hits a few high notes, but fails to stay on key throughout its brief performance.;Josiah Renaudin loves a good puzzle, whether it's found in a platfomer or a cardboard box. For the purpose of this review, he solved every riddle Metrico had to offer and walked away feeling just a bit smarter for it.
Rogue Legacy Review;8;Great; Great exploration and combat make Rogue Legacy a game you will want to play (and die in) over and over again.;Britton Peele fell in love with Rogue Legacy when he reviewed the original PC release for GameSpot in 2012, in part because it tugged at the strings of his Castlevania-loving heart. He finished one full playthrough and a bit of new game plus, switching between all three PlayStation platforms throughout.
Super Comboman Review;3;Bad; Super Comboman fuses platforming, action, and fighting into a single failure.;Dan Starkey is no stranger to hard games, fighting games, or beat-'em-ups, but he could only barely make it through Super Comboman. He's glad he can finally put this cramp-inducing nightmare behind him.
Siesta Fiesta Review;7;Good; While it's just a charming Breakout clone on the surface, Siesta Fiesta has enough tricks to make it something you don't want to sleep through.;Britton Peele is no stranger to chips off the Breakout block, from Arkanoid to Firestriker to Wizorb. He spent about four hours completing all of Siesta Fiesta's levels, occasionally going back to try (in vain) for a gold medal.
Unrest Review;6;Fair; Unrest is an unconventional but erratic adventure game that inspires empathy even as it undercuts its own message.;Cameron Woolsey enjoys the simplicity of traditional morality systems in games, but found Unrest to be refreshing. For the purposes of this review, Cameron spent around 10 hours playing the game multiple times, completing his first run in around four and a half hours.
Dark Souls II: Crown of the Sunken King Review;8;Great; Crown of the Sunken King sets an effective tone for Dark Souls II's Lost Crowns trilogy with inventive environments and fearsome new foes.;Having video-captured GameSpot's Dark Souls II boss battles, Miguel was naturally inclined to take on the game's first DLC. Eight hours later, he doesn't miss the corrosive egg crawlers.
The Last of Us Remastered Review;8;Great; The Last of Us Remastered is a spruced-up edition of one of the most well-crafted action adventure games of the last console generation.;Carolyn originally played through The Last of Us when it was released on the PlayStation 3 last year. For the purposes of this review, she participated in a multiplayer session organized by Sony.
King's Bounty: Dark Side Review;8;Great; Lengthy quests and catchy tactical combat are at the black heart of King's Bounty: Dark Side.;Brett Todd cruised the dark side to check out the selling points of evil for around 30 hours in the course of writing this review. Having played (and reviewed) several King's Bounty games, he is intimately familiar with the series.
Divinity: Original Sin Review;9;Superb; The excellent Divinity: Original Sin isn't a look into the history of role-playing games, but instead a look into their future.;Longtime role-player Kevin VanOrd spent 65 hours playing Divinity: Original Sin, and still feels like he's only touched on some of the intricate systems that makes the game so extraordinary. His favorite Divinity talent is Leech
Sniper Elite III Review;6;Fair; Sniper Elite III can be a chore, but its gleeful X-ray kills help make up for its deficiencies.;Josiah Renaudin is a sucker for a good sniping sequence, and has patiently sat atop perches in dozens of shooters to set up the perfect shot. He completed Sniper Elite III's campaign and continuously tried to connect to multiplayer games for the purpose of this review.
Infinity Runner Review;5;Mediocre; It tries to add something new with its story mode, but Infinity Runner isn't much more than a rote Temple Run clone.;Britton Peele spent more time than he would like to admit playing Temple Run 2 and has played enough Canabalt to know that he's not very good at Canabalt. He finished Infinity Runner's story one and a half times and earned a majority of its achievements before writing this review.
MouseCraft Review;6;Fair; A cheesy puzzler with plenty of charm, MouseCraft favors style over substance.;After spending six or so hours with MouseCraft's malnourished, mistreated lab rats, Matt Cabral grew to appreciate the hungry rodents' plight. Well, either that or he was just really craving a grilled cheese sandwich.
Gods Will Be Watching Review;6;Fair; Emotional storytelling and challenging gameplay can't wholly save Gods Will Be Watching from some of its bad design choices.;Cameron Woolsey enjoyed the majority of Gods Will Be Watching, but he would walk over hot coals before playing through its desert mission again. For the purpose of this review, Cameron played around 18 hours, gaining a few more gray hairs in the process.
Wayward Manor Review;4;Poor; A host of glitches keep Wayward Manor feeling anything but welcoming.;Cameron Woolsey spent several hours as the bump in the night, though he wishes less of that time involved hitting the reset button. For the purpose of this review, Cameron completed the game, winning the hard-fought battle against an army of game-ending bugs.
Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty Review;8;Great; The most fragile hero of side-scrolling platforming returns in a beautiful reimagining of Abe's Oddysee.;"Daniel survived the Stockyards, persevered through the Paramonion Temple, and bested the Scrabanian Nests to complete Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty in six hours. He rescued 170 of the 300 captive Mudokons, netting himself the good ending. About 20 Mudokons ""accidentally"" perished."
Child of Light Review;8;Great; Child of Light is a wonderful fairy tale of a game, with a gorgeous and imaginative realm to explore and a melancholy story at its heart.;Carolyn first started playing Child of Light when it was released on consoles, but when she heard it was coming to Vita, she waited, thinking that the game would be a good fit for the handheld. She was pleased to find that it is, and spent about 12 hours accompanying Aurora on her adventure.
Xenonauts Review;8;Great; Xenonauts is an excellent strategy game that casts you as Earth's only line of defense against an apparently omnipresent extraterrestrial threat.;This is the third time Dan Starkey has used his strategic talents to collect and reverse-engineer alien technology to repel an invasion. He's gotten pretty good at it, but Xenonauts still claimed 61 hours of his life. They were well spent.
War Thunder Review;8;Great; Smooth and exciting aerial and tank action is at the heart of War Thunder, a big and broad multiplayer excursion back to World War II.;Brett Todd flew the not-so-friendly skies and rumbled around on the terra firma of War Thunder for about 10 hours in the course of writing this review.
Richard & Alice Review;5;Mediocre; Strong writing isn't enough to establish the apocalyptic stakes at play in Richard & Alice.;It took Nick three hours to play through Richard & Alice's story. He‰Ûªs more of a warm weather guy.
Ace Combat Infinity Review;6;Fair; Ace Combat Infinity casts a cynical eye at its own pedigree, but some vestiges of joy remain.;Nick Capozzoli has done more trademarked Ace Combat trench runs than he cares to admit. For the purposes of this review, he played through Infinity's available campaign missions and a few weeks' worth of multiplayer.
Spoiler Alert Review;4;Poor; Spoiler Alert's reverse platforming isn't a strong enough gimmick to make it worth bothering with.;Josiah Renaudin has been jumping from platform to platform since the early days of the original Nintendo, with Super Mario World standing as one of his all-time favorite platformers. For the purpose of this review, Josiah completed all 100 levels and created a few stages of his own.
The Wolf Among Us Episode 5: Cry Wolf Review;6;Fair; Cry Wolf brings The Wolf Among Us to an uneven conclusion, but still packs the occasional emotional punch.;Kevin VanOrd played The Wolf Among Us in its entirety, but wishes it had concluded on a stronger note. He continues to make his way through the Fables comics, and will be sad when he runs out of Fables-related stories to experience.
Transformers: Rise of the Dark Spark Review;4;Poor; Offering no more than meets the eye, Transformers: Rise of the Dark Spark is just a shallow, frustrating, and incoherent third-person shooter.;Carolyn has been following the Transformers in one form or another since they first went up against the Gobots for the hearts and minds of American children in the 1980s. Rise of the Dark Spark isn't the worst Transformers game she's played. That honor goes to the Wii game Transformers: Dark of the Moon - Stealth Force Edition, in which you couldn't even transform.
Blood of the Werewolf Review;8;Great; Blood of the Werewolf has never been better than on the Xbox 360, offering improved platforming and refined pacing.;Cameron Woolsey is still waiting for the Young Frankenstein video game, but is content with playing Blood of the Werewolf a second time, for now. For the purpose of this review, Cameron spent about seven hours reacquainting himself with the game's smashers and deadly pitfalls.
GRID Autosport Review;6;Fair; Grid Autosport is often too ambitious for its own good, resulting in a diverse but inconsistent racer.;Due to an unholy attraction to burnt rubber and garish paintjobs, as well as an obsession with the racing genre, John couldn't help but jump at the opportunity to get behind the wheel of Grid Autosport. Before writing this review, he won the Grid Legends Series, the elite event of Autosport and the symbol of digital racing prowess.
Tales From Space: Mutant Blobs Attack Review;6;Fair; The blob is back, but his adventure stumbles.;Jason Venter has played dozens of platformers throughout the years, including the Vita version of When Mutant Blobs Attack.
EA Sports UFC Review;5;Mediocre; EA Sports UFC looks almost as good as a real MMA fight, but poorly balanced systems dull the excitement.;Josiah Renaudin has watched every UFC event since 2007, spending most Saturday nights glued to the TV. He's deeply invested in the sport, and often fruitlessly tries to properly grapple and box in real life. For the purposes of this review, Josiah earned the UFC lightweight belt and fought in more than 30 online fights.
Valiant Hearts: The Great War Review;8;Great; With beautiful art, a sentimental story, and gameplay that emphasizes helping people rather than killing them, Valiant Hearts: The Great War is a refreshingly different kind of war game.;Carolyn played through Valiant Hearts on the PC before writing this review. It took about six hours. She prefers Walt, the dog in Valiant Hearts, to Riley, the dog in Call of Duty: Ghosts.
WildStar Review;7;Good; WildStar is a colorful and traditional online role-playing game that evokes the compulsive need to fight everything you can fight, and click everything you can click.;Kevin VanOrd has played so many massively multiplayer games that he's lost count of the exact number. He is usually drawn to pet classes, but he spent most of his 70-plus hours in WildStar as an offensive spellslinger of the Mordesh race.
Shovel Knight Review;7;Good; Shovel Knight recalls, but doesn't rely on, many greats from gaming's past, but lacks the inventive spark that could have elevated it to classic territory.;The retro resurgence has made Tom incredibly happy because he still believes that much of what made the games from his youth so appealing hasn't been improved upon. After sinking 15 hours into Shovel Knight, he enjoyed but wasn't enamored with this 2D adventure.
Anomaly Defenders Review;5;Mediocre; Anomaly Defenders ditches the series' prior innovations for something more familiar and far less thrilling.;After playing through both previous games as the humans, Nathan was intrigued to hop to the other side of the fence in Defenders. Plowing through this far-less-interesting alien campaign in only a handful of hours, however, felt like it took eons.
The Elder Scrolls Online Review - Familiar World Strange Territory Review;6;Fair; For a fan of the series, The Elder Scrolls Online makes for a pleasant return to Tamriel. It's just not a terribly great MMO.;After pouring hundreds of hours into the Elder Scrolls franchise over the years, Shaun McInnis used The Elder Scrolls Online as an opportunity to finally take a shot at the MMO genre. With his Nord Dragonknight, Shaun made it to level 22 before beginning this review.
Magical Beat Review;6;Fair; Solid puzzling and catchy tunes back up Magical Beat, but a dearth of content stops the show prematurely.;Fighting games and MOBAs might be the hot genres for competition right now, but Heidi argues that a fierce battle in a competitive puzzle game results in some of the finest quality salt around. It's a shame Magical Beat is so feature-devoid, as she yearns for a new puzzle game in which to crush her enemies online. (Any hope of Puyo Puyo Tetris coming to the West? Probably not...)
Nether Review;5;Mediocre; Nether's dire world can be immersive, but glaring issues ranging from unbalanced mechanics to glitches prevent you from getting swept away.;Cameron Woolsey has played many games where he spent untold hours fighting to survive against grueling odds. For the sake of this review, Cameron played for about 30 hours, reaching level 32 and an account level of 15.
Hegemony Rome: The Rise of Caesar Review;5;Mediocre; Repetitious play, shallow mechanics, and squandered potential all make Hegemony Rome a mediocre experience.;Dan Starkey was a huge fan of the first Hegemony and had high hopes for the second. To date, he has spent about 24 hours pretending to be Julius Caesar and conquering what is now modern-day France.
Killzone: Shadow Fall Intercept Review;6;Fair; Killzone: Shadow Fall Intercept's mishmash of co-op ideas doesn't make for the most compelling of experiences.;Mark might not be the shooting powerhouse he once was, but he enjoys the odd skirmish in Counterstrike and Titanfall. He's played his way through Killzone 3 and Shadow Fall, and has always admired the impressive technical achievements of the series, even if he hasn't been as impressed with the gameplay.
1001 Spikes Review;8;Great; 1001 Spikes will kill you, but it does so in a way that's both fair and fun.;Britton Peele enjoys a challenge and thought he was a hotshot for beating Super Meat Boy until he realized that he would never able to finish every dark world stage. He completed the main game in 1001 Spikes, found 24 of the golden skulls, and completed the Tower of Nanner twice before writing this review. He woke up his wife only once by shouting at his Vita upon dying during a level.
Entwined Review;7;Good; Comforting colors, excellent sound design, and simple gameplay make Entwined a lovely and fleeting experience.;Kevin VanOrd has taken many an abstract journey in his day, and Flow and Flower remain two of his favorites. He played Entwined's story twice, and completed every challenge level.
Kill the Bad Guy Review;7;Good; Destructive mayhem and revenge fantasies are at the heart of Kill the Bad Guy, a lightweight but engaging puzzler.;Brett Todd electrocuted, crushed, flattened, speared, blew up, and otherwise slaughtered bad guys for about five hours in the course of writing the review for Kill the Bad Guy.
Tomodachi Life Review;7;Good; Tomodachi Life brings the quirk in spades, but it's not long before the novelty wears off.;Life sims might not be one of Mark's favorite genres, but he has dabbled with The Sims and tended a garden or two in Animal Crossing. For the purposes of this review, Mark's Miis got married, had some babies, and took part in the odd rap battle or two in the town square.
Always Sometimes Monsters Review;5;Mediocre; The alleys of Always Sometimes Monsters hide both trash and treasure alike;Nick Capozzoli grinded through Always Sometimes Monsters' story over the course of a dozen hours, mostly carrying crates from one side of a factory to another. Watch out for that crate part.
Munin Review;6;Fair; Britton Peele is a fan of both ancient mythology and puzzle games, but Munin wasn't the chocolate and peanut butter combo he was hoping for. He solved all of Munin's ...;Britton Peele is a fan of both ancient mythology and puzzle games, but Munin wasn't the chocolate and peanut butter combo he was hoping for. He solved all of Munin's puzzles before writing this review.
Space Run Review;8;Great; Space Run is an exciting tower defense game in which you rocket through the galaxy at warp speed.;Cameron Woolsey has spent many hours playing tower defense games and games set in space. Space Run was the first time he experienced both at once, and he looks forward to many more hours shipping cargo and fighting space pirates.
Enemy Front Review;5;Mediocre; The wartime journey of a gun-wielding news reporter is fraught with Nazi aggression, poor game design, frustrating glitches, and an unconvincing message of rebellion.;Due to his adult-onset appreciation for World War II history and the fact that there are few games that deal with the war's resistance movements, Miguel jumped at the chance to play through Enemy Front's campaign and multiplayer. He's currently considering washing down the experience by replaying Medal of Honor: Underground.
Air Control Review;1;Abysmal; Air Control is 30 minutes worth of horrific, broken nonsense.;Kevin has a fear of flying. But he now fears flying in Air Control even more. He spent two agonizing hours with Air Control, even though you can see everything in under 30 minutes.
Among the Sleep Review;7;Good; Among the Sleep makes good use of its unusual concept, taking you on a distinctive journey through the frightening dreams of a young child.;Carolyn is no stranger to scary games. Intrigued by Among the Sleep's concept, she backed the game's Kickstarter campaign last year. She played through Among the Sleep once before writing this review.
Super Ultra Dead Rising 3 Arcade Remix Hyper Edition EX Plus Alpha Review;7;Good; Super Dead Rising 3 Arcade Remix is a fun, nostalgia-fueled romp through Capcom's history.;Dead Rising 3 was Britton Peele's favorite game from the Xbox One launch. Super Dead Rising 3 Arcade Remix tugged at the strings of his nostalgic heart more than once, and he liked it enough to unlock everything and earn every achievement before writing this review.
Project Temporality Review;4;Poor; Glitches and a dire lack of puzzle variation keep Project Temporality from being time well spent.;Cameron Woolsey is always up for a good puzzle game, but will happily knock one point off the score for every slide puzzle he comes across. For the purpose of this review, Cameron spent about 7 hours partying and crashing down doors with his favorite people in the whole world: his clones.
The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing 2 Review;8;Great; The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing II taps the spirit of classic action role-playing games and delivers a great combat system and an exciting world.;Dan Starkey hunted vampires, demons, and undead abominations with his trusty arcane grenade launcher. After being bored for the first couple of hours, he quickly warmed up to the gothic fantasy adventure.
Where Is My Heart? Review;7;Good; A clever twist on puzzle platforming, Where Is My Heart knows to end before it gets tiresome.;Britton Peele wouldn't mind getting lost in nature were it not for his fear of never finding his way back home. He saw the end in Where Is My Heart after a couple of hours and kept exploring stages for a while before writing this review.
Ultra Street Fighter IV Review;8;Great; Ultra Street Fighter IV brings with it five new characters, four new stages, three new game mechanics, and a whole host of other changes that make it the definitive Street ...;While he may have more L's than W's in his logbook, Maxwell McGee is still a longtime fan of both fighting games and Street Fighter IV. Together, he and Cody face down the many rivals who stalk GameSpot's offices. And for some reason, they're all Ibuki players.
Drakengard 3 Review;7;Good; It's technically awkward, hard to look at, and sometimes tedious to play. But Drakengard 3's distinctly strange and fascinating world, characters, and structure make it a one-of-a-kind experience.;Ever since she reviewed Nier for GamePro years back, Heidi has taken an interest in the games Yoko Taro has created. After spending dozens of hours with Drakengard 3 and reaching its true ending, she can confidently claim it to be one of her favorite games so far this year.
Murdered: Soul Suspect Review;6;Fair; It's easy to be overwhelmed by the many problems in Murdered: Soul Suspect, but if you dig a little deeper, there's an interesting story to uncover.;Tom has always been drawn to virtual investigations, so the slow-paced investigations of Soul Suspect were right up his alley. He spent more than 10 hours in Salem completing as many side stories as time would allow.
Mind Zero Review;4;Poor; Mind Zero's attempts to mimic a proven success are foiled by a dull story and plodding, aggravating gameplay.;Heidi didn't know much about Mind Zero going in. The lack of an in-game clock makes it hard for her to judge just how much time she spent playing it, but she's still pretty bitter about wasting a few dozen hours on Mind Zero when Mario Kart 8 is sitting right over there.
Pushmo World Review;7;Good; Pushmo World's colorful conundrums are a pleasant and absorbing way to occupy your brain.;Carolyn loves a good contemplative puzzle game, with the Picross series in particular having kept her happily occupied for many, many hours.
The Wolf Among Us: Episode 4 - In Sheep's Clothing Review;7;Good; In Sheep's Clothing continues A Wolf Among Us' intriguing and violent story, with only a bit of wheel-spinning to slow it down.;Kevin VanOrd finished In Sheep's Clothing in about 90 minutes. His Bigby is a no-nonsense detective who is gentle with his friends but aggressive when cornered, and he hopes this season of The Wolf Among Us is successful enough that there will be more in the future.
Borderlands 2 Review;7;Good; Borderlands 2 on the Vita preserves the lion's share of the game's significant appeal despite some shortcomings.;Chris Watters reviewed Borderlands 2 on every other platform and spent many hours in various DLC packs. He loves the artistic style, sense of humor, and chaotic battles, and enjoyed the dozen or so hours he spent with the Vita version.
Nutjitsu Review;4;Poor; If the foxes in Nutjitsu want those mystic acorns so much, they can keep them.;Jason Venter likes acorns as much as the next guy, and his appreciation for action puzzle games goes back to a time when arcade cabinets were more common than payphone booths, but spending several hours ranking up his squirrel in Nutjitsu was just about enough to drive him nutty.
Mario Kart 8 Review;8;Great; Mario Kart 8 shifts its focus from chaotic weapons to precise driving, and that makes this one of the most rewarding entries in the series.;Tom firmly believes that Super Mario Kart is still the best game in the franchise, but loves just about every new entry. He spent more than 40 hours playing Mario Kart 8 across every mode. Not to brag, but with the help of Max Hulburt, he got a three-star rating on every cup.
Warlock 2 Review;7;Good; Warlock 2 is a strong sequel that deftly builds on the solid foundation of its predecessor. Unfortunately, not all of its ideas are fully realized.;Dan spent over 27 hours in several matches conquering the planes of the elements and summoning an army of dragons to support his cause. His eternal search for a perfect strategy game is still far from over, but he's pleased to see people are still getting creative with one of the older genres around.
Minecraft: PlayStation 3 Edition Review;8;Great; Minecraft: PlayStation 3 Edition provides the core gameplay experience you're looking for, though it takes a few steps back from the PC version.;Cameron Woolsey has played Minecraft on nearly every system, including smartphones. In his combined time, he has built mansions, underground lairs, snaking railway systems, and a tree house in the jungle. But his favorite would have to be a farmhouse on the edge of a grassy plain and a lake, where he takes a break from mining to do a little fishing.
Blade Symphony Review;5;Mediocre; For all its slick flourishes, this intriguing sword-dueling game could still use a lot of sharpening.;Battling through tons of multiplayer matches and fighting plenty of one-on-one duels with all four fighters and lots of different blades, Nathan thought he'd seen it all. That is, until one goofy opponent spent an entire match prancing around in a wild costume without bothering to try to land a single blow.
Memento Mori 2: Guardians of Immortality Review;4;Poor; It has lofty goals as a globe-trotting mystery, but Memento Mori 2 is a poor localization of a poor adventure game.;Britton Peele has been on The Longest Journey, sailed to Monkey Island, and linked to Myst a half-dozen times. He's usually up for a good adventure, but he wishes he'd stayed home for this one.
Watch Dogs Review;8;Great; Watch Dogs' attempts to say something serious are overshadowed by how enormously fun it is to create chaos in its impressive open world.;Kevin VanOrd spent 30-plus hours with Watch Dogs at a press review event and played many hours outside of the event. He finished the story, yet only reached 52 percent completion. He unlocked every ctOS tower, solved an optional murder case, and played every digital trip, and looks forward to reaching 100 percent completion.
World of Tanks Updated Review;8;Great; When it comes to blowing up military monstrosities, no game does it better than World of Tanks.;"A casual interest in tanks quickly turned to a ""gotta-catch-'em-all"" obsession for Nathan, who has clocked hundreds of battles in both the PC version and Xbox 360 version of World of Tanks."
Wolfenstein: The New Order Review;8;Great; In the Nazi-dominated alternate history of 1960, it takes more than big guns to topple this new regime.;Daniel finds comfort in the aural feedback of a shotgun, in shattering a demon into tiny giblets, and in scrounging the environment for health packs and armour to stay alive, and keeps on shooting. He blasted through The New Order's singleplayer campaign on PS4 in roughly 12 hours, and replayed a few more hours on PC on a higher difficulty.
Monochroma Review;4;Poor; Monochroma wastes its gripping premise and eye-catching visual design by having clunky controls and a wealth of inconsistencies.;Tom adores puzzle platformers, and was intrigued by Monochroma after playing it at the Game Developers Conference. But he struggled to finish Monochroma even though it's only five hours long because of its many unavoidable problems.
Kentucky Route Zero - Act III Review;9;Superb; Kentucky Route Zero: Act III is the boldest, most extraordinary chapter yet in this transcendent American road journey.;There's something about Kentucky Route Zero, something haunting and sad, that reminds Carolyn of all those hours she spent watching America roll by out the window on family road trips as a child.
Bound By Flame Review;4;Poor; Bound by Flame is a rickety role-playing game that bites off far more than it can chew.;Kevin likes an ambitious role-playing game, but after swearing his way through Bound by Flame's second half and vanquishing the final boss after countless tries, he's glad to leave this one behind. He finished at level 23 and spent most of his skill points in the warrior tree.
Tropico 5 Review;8;Great; Tropico 5's irreverent wit and smooth difficulty curve make governing your own banana republic an easy and enjoyable experience.;The shoes of El Presidente are hard to fill, but Maxwell is up to the challenge, even if he is a newcomer to the Tropico series. After 22 hours with the game he now spends his days sipping drinks on the beach and pondering whether building a casino next to a church is a bad idea.
The Walking Dead: Season 2 Episode 3 - In Harm's Way Review;8;Great; Clementine's soul and skin are in peril in In Harm's Way, this season's most harrowing episode yet of The Walking Dead.;Brett Todd watched it and regretted it in this episode of The Walking Dead. He also played the game through to completion in a couple of hours.
Super Time Force Review;8;Great; Super Time Force gleefully shreds conventional concepts of time travel in both its writing and gameplay, making it a refreshing twist on the side-scrolling shooter.;Carolyn has been playing side-scrolling shooters since the NES era and finished Super Time Force on the default difficulty setting. Her understanding of how time works owes more to Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure than to A Brief History of Time.
Final Fantasy XIV Online: A Realm Reborn Review;8;Great; Final Fantasy XIV is reborn on the PlayStation 4, rife with new features and gorgeous visuals that will tempt PC and PlayStation 3 players all over again.;Brittany Vincent is a Hyur black mage hailing from the world of Final Fantasy XI as a Mithra white mage. She spent upward of 35 hours for the purposes of this review in the PlayStation 4 edition of Final Fantasy XIV, though the PC edition has previously been her Eorzean home.
Dark Souls 2 Review - A Newcomer in Drangleic Review;5;Mediocre; Dark Souls II can be tedious and unwelcoming for someone who hasn't already come to terms with the series.;For this review, Justin spent 25 hours in the game, killed five bosses, reached level 65, and lit too many bonfires.
Sportsfriends Review;8;Great; Sportsfriends' simple games provide some of the best local multiplayer you and a few friends can have.;Britton Peele has only minimal experience playing sports, but he has a lot of friends. He played dozens of matches of every game in the Sportsfriends collection before writing this review, varying up the number of players throughout.
Grand Theft Auto Online Updated Review;6;Fair; Grand Theft Auto Online is both exhilarating and infuriating, often at the same time, and a lack of structure makes your criminal exploits feel kind of meaningless.;Carolyn has played and loved every major release in the Grand Theft Auto series since GTA III. After originally playing Grand Theft Auto Online when it first launched, she spent about 10 hours back in the Los Santos of GTA Online prior to writing this review.
Titanfall Review - Through the Eyes of a Lapsed Combatant Review;8;Great; Titanfall mixes parkour and mechs for a competitive shooter that will entice even the most jaded player back onto the battlefield.;Peter hasn't found a competitive shooter that he's truly liked since Halo 3, and was delighted enough with Titanfall's gameplay that he played around 20 hours between the PC, Xbox One, and Xbox 360 versions before writing his review.
Sir You Are Being Hunted Review;4;Poor; Sir, You Are Being Hunted doesn't execute on the premise in its own name.;Sir Nick Capozzoli spent a dozen hours with Sir, You Are Being Hunted as a curiously savage aristocrat, and dabbled with a few of the alternate classes on hand.
Broken Sword 5: The Serpent's Curse - Part II Review;6;Fair; Broken Sword 5: The Serpent's Curse's second half charms and delights, but glitches and a more linear focus tarnish the overall delivery.;Cameron Woolsey has spent years besting some of the finest adventure games, and gets strangely excited to find a use for a ball of yarn he's kept in his inventory for the majority of a game. For the purpose of this review, Cameron played around five hours, with a grand total of around 11 hours for both parts of the game.
Batman: Arkham Origins - Cold Cold Heart Review;7;Good; Cold, Cold Heart fumbles its ending, but benefits from a solid narrative foundation and a strong sense of momentum.;Carolyn has played through all of the Arkham games except Arkham Origins: Blackgate. Cold, Cold Heart took her about three hours to complete. Her favorite Batman is Michael Keaton.
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: All Star Battle Review;6;Fair; JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: All Star Battle faithfully captures the extreme personality of its source material, but the game itself is more style than substance.;Before playing All Star Battle, Maxwell's knowledge of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure was a cobbled-together mishmash of the 1998 Capcom fighting game and some humorous Internet memes. Thankfully, his knowledge of fighting games is far more extensive.
Mario Golf: World Tour Review;7;Good; Mario Golf: World Tour is built upon strong mechanics, but too often relies on novelty value.;Stace Harman has been playing video game golf for more than two decades, and played close to 20 hours of Mario Golf: World Tour for this review. The Vita version of Everybody's Golf is a mainstay of his handheld gaming, and he has very fond memories of 2004's Mario Golf on the GBA.
The Elder Scrolls Online Review;6;Fair; The Elder Scrolls Online immerses you in its intricate quests and fantasy landscapes, only to undercut its strengths at every turn.;Kevin VanOrd's first massively multiplayer game was the original Asheron's Call, and he still thinks that Asheron's Call 2 was an underpraised gem. He's played every Elder Scrolls game since Daggerfall, and having spent 90 hours of adventuring in The Elder Scrolls Online, he's ready to hang up his staff.
Fract OSC Review;6;Fair; Fract OSC's chorus soars, but its verse languishes.;Nick Capozzoli spent a dozen hours working through Fract OSC's puzzles and fiddling with its in-game synthesizer program. He's pretty sure he'll eventually make something that doesn't shatter nearby glassware.
NES Remix 2 Review;7;Good; NES Remix is a fun way to remind yourself to play through the classics again.;Jason Venter has spent dozens of hours with most of the games that were reworked for NES Remix 2, and he happily spent most of another dozen hours chasing after three-star ratings and stamps for the sake of his review. He has clearly caught the Nintendo bug.
Kirby: Triple Deluxe Review;8;Great; Kirby: Triple Deluxe is a wildly inventive and colorful platformer that makes great use of 3D.;Mark's all-time favorite genre is the platformer, having spent many an hour with the likes of Super Mario, Rayman, and Kirby. He played all the way through to the end of Triple Deluxe for this review, and is currently working his way through a second time as King Dedede.
Daylight Review;3;Bad; Don't be afraid of the dark in the shallow and cliched horror adventure Daylight.;Kevin VanOrd has loved scary games ever since he first visited the famous town of Silent Hill. He played Daylight seven times for the purposes of this review.
The Amazing Spider-Man 2 Review;5;Mediocre; The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is as fun as it is flawed, capturing the snarky joy of the webbed crusader amid the repetition of combat and tedious side quests.;Tom spent his Saturday mornings in his youth watching the Spider-Man cartoon, though he's never read a comic book. He's not embarrassed by that fact. It took him more than 15 hours to bring peace to Manhattan.
Moebius: Empire Rising Review;4;Poor; Moebius: Empire Rising is a short adventure bogged down by dull characters and tedious puzzle solving.;Cameron Woolsey doubts that any adventure game will delight him as as much as Sam & Max Hit the Road did, but he's wide open to the possibility. He spent around 12 hours playing Moebius, occasionally fighting off the urge to take a nap.
2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil Review;8;Great; More than a cynical cash-in, 2014 FIFA World Cup's worth comes from the depth of its key game modes.;John has been playing football games for over two decades, experiencing everything from the glories of Sensible Soccer to the horrors of David Beckham Soccer. Ten hours were spent in (digital) Brazil for the purposes of this review.
Conception II Review;5;Mediocre; Conception II has plenty of lust, but it lacks heart.;Britton Peele is not a parent to any children, magical or otherwise, but he has been a big fan of RPGs for most of his life and counts Final Fantasy VI among his favorite games of all time. He completed Conception II's main story, dabbled with New Game Plus, and reloaded a final save to see multiple endings before writing this review.
Life Goes On Review;8;Great; Life Goes On is a great, morbid puzzler that reminds you that there is no victory without sacrifice.;More concerned with completing levels than earning achievements, puzzle-solving veteran Matt Cabral shamelessly sacrificed the lives of hundreds of brave warriors while playing Life Goes On. His Knights of the Round Table membership has since been revoked.
Trials Fusion Review;8;Great; Trials Fusion delivers the same exciting racing action from previous games, with a beautiful new aesthetic and enough humor to keep you laughing.;Tom eventually brute-forced his way to the expert tracks, though may have gotten a little help along the way. His masochistic tendencies bring him toward challenging games, so Trials has been a consistent favorite.
Half Minute Hero: The Second Coming Review;8;Great; Ultra-fast-paced RPG gameplay, delightful parodies, and a wealth of new features make Half-Minute Hero: The Second Coming a blast to play.;The original Half-Minute Hero still ranks among Heidi's favorite games of the past five years, and seeing the sequel finally surface in English has made her exceptionally happy. She invites any and all fake heroes to try to prove their worth in multiplayer mode against her. Bring it on, chumps.
SimCity Updated Review;5;Mediocre; SimCity may finally be playable offline, but all of its flaws are just as evident now as they were before.;Brett Todd would have rather killed four or five hours proofreading old city bylaws than venturing once again into the mayor's office of SimCity.
Lego The Hobbit Review;5;Mediocre; Lego The Hobbit is charming, funny, faithful to the films, and incredibly tedious to play.;Carolyn is a huge fan of J.R.R. Tolkien and thinks Peter Jackson's films based on Tolkien's work are pretty neat. Lego The Hobbit is the first Lego game she's played since the days of the Lego Star Wars games.
Strike Suit Zero: Director's Cut Review;5;Mediocre; The Director's Cut version of last year's Strike Suit Zero is periodically entertaining, but clogged up with too much repetition and an unconvincing Transformer ship gimmick.;Space combat veteran Brett Todd played with his Transformer space ships in Strike Suit Zero: Director's Cut for over a dozen hours.
Borderlands 2: Headhunter 5 - Sir Hammerlock vs. the Son of Crawmerax Review;8;Great; Sir Hammerlock vs. the Son of Crawmerax ends the story of Borderlands 2 on a great note, providing a beautiful new location to explore, tough enemies, and loads of humor.;Cameron Woolsey has spent dozens of hours on Pandora slaying bandits and ending threshers with his trusty blade and sniper rifle. For the purpose of this review, Cameron spent about six hours enjoying the sun.
Demon Gaze Review;7;Good; Demon Gaze's unique battle elements and engaging first-person exploration make it a solid, enjoyable dungeon crawler.;Heidi honestly didn't expect much from Demon Gaze, and was pleasantly surprised to find out that it's a good Vita RPG. Strangely, the game doesn't have an internal timekeeper, but she played the game frequently for about two straight weeks to review it. Also, she assures us that all of the gazer memos she left you folks are totally helpful and not trolling at all. Hmm...
Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII - A Newcomer's Take Review;4;Poor; Lightning Returns proves to be a poor point of entry for a Final Fantasy newcomer despite its thorough explanations and extensive exposition.;After enjoying only a select few JRPGs over the years, Chris Watters dedicated just under 20 hours to Lightning Returns, his first ever Final Fantasy game.
The Wolf Among Us: Episode 3 - A Crooked Mile Review;8;Great; The Wolf Among Us hits its stride with an electrifying third installment.;Kevin VanOrd is enthralled by The Wolf Among Us, and is voraciously reading the comics that inspired Telltale's newest series. He has a few theories about where this mystery is headed, and looks forward to having them proven wrong. He finished A Crooked Mile in about 90 heart-pounding minutes.
Mercenary Kings Review;6;Fair; Mercenary Kings heads down several familiar paths at once, to mixed results.;Jason Venter spent nearly 50 hours exploring Mandragora Island to review Mercenary Kings, which is still a mere fraction of the time he previously enjoyed with many of the 8-bit and 16-bit action games that served as Mercenary Kings' obvious inspiration.
Kinect Sports Rivals Review;5;Mediocre; Kinect Sports Rivals is an uneven collection of sports-themed minigames that won't hold your interest for long.;Carolyn doesn't spend as much time outdoors being athletic as she knows she should. She's played plenty of motion-controlled sports games in the past
Planetside 2 Updated Review;9;Superb; PlanetSide 2 is war, plain and simple.;Tyler Hicks used to think Big Team Battle in the Halo series and Onslaught in Unreal Tournament were the true ways to play first-person shooters, until he played the original PlanetSide at a friend's house in high school. In PlanetSide 2, his battle rank 71 Vanu soldier has over 300 hours logged.
Arma 3 Updated Review;7;Good; Arma III's new campaign isn't going to win hearts and minds, but its creation suite stands strong.;Nick Capozzoli abandoned dozens of soldiers across the fields of Altis during his run through Arma III's full campaign and jaunts into available mods. It wasn't his fault--they just wouldn't listen.
Ragnarok Odyssey ACE Review;7;Good; Ragnarok Odyssey returns to the hunt with some new tricks tucked into its armor, along with some old irritants.;After tackling both Toukiden: Age of Demons and Ragnarok Odyssey ACE this year, Matt Cabral has more than earned his black belt in monster hunting. If your fantasy world is ever threatened by hell-spawn or giants, you know who to call.
MLB 14: The Show Review;8;Great; MLB 14: The Show delivers a fast, tight, great-looking game of baseball.;Jack DeVries used to spend every day creating custom teams in RBI Baseball on the Genesis so that he could pretend he was an MLB star. Now he watches a lot of baseball-themed anime and has serious opinions on stadium architecture.
Castlevania: Lords of Shadows 2 - Revelations Review;4;Poor; Alucard's tale in Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 - Revelations DLC falls flat, and there are too few combat sequences to get the most out of his unique skill set.;Peter's completed every game in the Lords of Shadow series, and he played through Revelations on the default and highest difficulty settings for this review.
Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster Review;8;Great; Much more than a pretty role-playing game, Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster is an excellent collection of two PlayStation 2 classics.;Josiah Renaudin filled out the entire sphere grid for all seven Final Fantasy X characters twice when he was in junior high. Those experiences, along with multiple playthroughs of other Final Fantasy games, have made him quite the series fan. For the purposes of this review, Josiah defeated Sin and still teared up at the ending.
Escape Goat 2 Review;7;Good; It's not especially unique, but well-designed puzzles make Escape Goat 2 a lot of fun.;Britton Peele has been solving block-focused puzzles since Chip challenged him on his father's PC as a child. He managed to solve about 80 percent of Escape Goat 2's puzzles before writing this review.
Deus Ex: The Fall Review;4;Poor; The PC port of last year's iPad prequel to Deus Ex: Human Revolution could do with a few augmentations.;Daniel Hindes is a Deus Ex veteran, having poured countless hours into the 2000 original, its 2004 sequel Invisible War, and the 2011 prequel Human Revolution. He always opts for the stealth pistol and an inconspicuous ventilation shaft.
Age of Wonders III Review;7;Good; The Age of Wonders series returns with a fun and dynamic turn-based strategy game that plants its focus squarely on creating exciting battles.;Maxwell McGee is new to the Age of Wonders series, but had no trouble diving into and understanding Age of Wonders III. And even after a dozen campaigns, he still discovers something new with every battle.
Betrayer Review;7;Good; The colorless world of Betrayer is home to an intriguing mystery, tense atmosphere, and inconsistent enemies.;Cameron Woolsey has slept with the lights on ever since stepping foot into the Otherworld, and is considering taking up archery. For the purpose of this review, Cameron played around 15 hours, completing the game and collecting secret treasures.
Infamous: Second Son Review;8;Great; The gorgeous world of Infamous: Second Son is brimming with delights, setting you loose in Seattle to partake in fast-paced, inventive combat that's an absolute blast.;Tom adores the chaotic frenzy of the Infamous franchise. He played through Second Son twice for this review, getting 100 percent both times. It took him 16 hours his first time through as a good Delsin on medium and 10 hours the second time as an evil Delsin on expert.
Dragons and Titans Review;3;Bad; Dragons and Titans is a halfhearted and frustrating online arena that doesn't deserve your time.;Tyler Hicks lives and breathes the MOBA genre. He couldn't pass up the opportunity to breathe various elements as a dragon, and gave Dragons and Titans eight levels, the single-player campaign, and many hours' worth of multiplayer matches to prove itself.
The Witch and the Hundred Knight Review;6;Fair; There's some meaty, complex gameplay to The Witch and the Hundred Knight, but you'll need to endure a terrible lead character and a plodding opening stretch to make it that ...;Heidi counts herself among the fan base for NIS's distinct style of experimental and complex game systems. Witch has been on her radar for quite some time, and though the end product was disappointing, she has high hopes for NIS's announced PS4 game in development. Hopefully that one won't take three years to hit the market.
Smite Review;8;Great; Smite puts the powers of the gods in your hands as you engage in a battle that will rattle the heavens.;Tyler Hicks utters the word MOBA so often that he has been mistaken for a new Pokemon species. Although his roots in the genre are firmly with League of Legends, he mastered seven gods and reached level 14 in Smite in order to provide this review.
BioShock infinite: Burial at Sea - Episode 2 Review;8;Great; The excellent Burial at Sea - Episode 2 marks a welcome return to form for BioShock Infinite.;In spite of its post-release backlash, Kevin VanOrd still loves BioShock Infinite, even though he was gravely disappointed by Burial at Sea's first episode. He's on his second playthrough of the new episode, which took him about three and a half hours the first time through.
Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft Review;8;Great; Hearthstone is a free-to-play collectible card game that embraces new players through its presentation and simplicity and satisfies veterans with complex strategies hidden between the lines.;Leif Johnson was originally one of those folks who shied away from Magic: The Gathering events, but eventually he got over it. He‰Ûªs enjoyed the renaissance of sorts that collectible card gaming has enjoyed with new digital games, and he prefers to play with Hearthstone‰Ûªs Hunter deck. Leif has been playing Hearthstone since the first beta invites went out last year.
Diablo 3: Reaper of Souls Review;8;Great; Reaper of Souls brings great new campaign content to Diablo III while also giving you tantalizing reasons to revisit the places you've already been.;Carolyn spent some time playing as a crusader and exploring Adventure mode on a test realm set up by Blizzard prior to the expansion's release. She played through the new campaign content once the expansion went live. She prefers not to be reminded that she has now spent well over 100 hours playing Diablo III.
Shadowrun: Dragonfall Review;8;Great; Fantastic atmosphere and stellar writing make Shadowrun: Dragonfall a great adaptation of its cyberpunk source material.;Daniel Starkey has been running the shadows since he was a child, and is cautiously optimistic about the future of Harebrained Schemes' new system.
Luftrausers Review;7;Good; Luftrausers' arcadelike simplicity makes conquering the skies feel natural and fun.;The closest Britton Peele has come to the fantasy of being a world-class fighter pilot was probably that time he watched Top Gun and got his hair cut in the style of Tom Cruise. He played around 10 hours of Luftrausers across the PC, PS3, and Vita for the purposes of this review.
Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Review;8;Great; Less crossover and more combination, the excellent Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney provides each of its stars equal face time.;John Robertson has been solving puzzles and defending accused innocents since the original Professor Layton and Phoenix Wright games transformed the original DS into one of the greatest handhelds of all time. Well over 30 hours were spent puzzling and objecting before writing this review.
Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Z Review;4;Poor; The sloppy action of Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Z makes it a particularly poor entry in the long line of Dragon Ball Z games.;Heidi believes in giving every game a fair shake, and anime licensed games should be no different. After all, Treasure made some pretty slick Bleach and Yu Yu Hakusho fighters, and Capcom's take on Jojo's Bizarre Adventure introduced her to one of her favorite manga series. Battle of Z, however, is something she'd just like to never have to touch again.
Infested Planet Review;8;Great; This innovative alien bug-blasting indie real-time strategy game proves that fun runs deeper than meets the eye.;A longtime RTS enthusiast, Nathan has been bored with many of the ho-hum offerings in the genre of late. Infested Planet proved to him once again that cool innovations can come in small packages.
The Yawhg Review;6;Fair; The Yawhg is a fine board-game-inspired diversion for a spell of rain, but don't expect to wait out a long storm with it.;Nick Capozzoli is a regular at fictitious pubs throughout the RPG scene. For the purposes of this review, he played through The Yawhg a couple of dozen times.
Yoshi's New Island Review;5;Mediocre; Yoshi's New Island lacks the imagination that made its progenitor beloved, instead offering a slow-paced adventure that's too easy for its own good.;Tom was one of the few who enjoyed Yoshi's Island DS and has even loved easy platformers such as Kirby's Epic Yarn. But after spending nine hours with Yoshi's New Island, he's incredibly sad about where this franchise has gone.
NaissanceE Review;8;Great; The world of NaissanceE is mysterious, hostile, and starkly beautiful.;Nick Capozzoli is an architect by trade, which might make him more receptive to NaissanceE than some. For the purposes of this review, he played through the game over the course of approximately 10 hours.
Diablo 3 Review;8;Great; Significant changes to the loot system in a recent patch make Diablo III a more rewarding game than it's ever been.;Carolyn has always enjoyed a good fantasy hack-and-slash RPG, with Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance being a particular favorite. She's more motivated by the prospect of vanquishing evil than the allure of sweet gear. She's now logged a total of 90 hours with Diablo III.
Resident Evil 4 HD Edition Review;8;Great; Resident Evil 4 finally gets the PC version it always deserved, with only a few visual stumbles to detract from its brilliance.;Cameron Woolsey is no stranger to zombies or any sort of infected folk, and keeps a fire axe near his desk at all times---just in case. For the purposes of this review, Cameron played about 25 hours, completing the main campaign and unlockable side missions.
Basement Crawl Review;3;Bad; Basement Crawl tries to emulate Bomberman with a horror setting, but fails to ignite on all accounts.;Britton Peele lives in Texas, where basements are practically nonexistent. Therefore, he has never crawled in one, but if he had one, he probably would have used it to play Bomberman with his friends all day. He played dozens of Basement Crawl matches before writing this review.
South Park: The Stick of Truth Review;7;Good; South Park: The Stick of Truth is as simplistic as role-playing games come, but it captures the spirit of the animated show's riotous raunch.;Kevin VanOrd has spent most of his life insisting that he is not fat, but big-boned, and has always looked to Eric Cartman as his primary inspiration. He loves South Park and crude humor, and has played more role-playing games than you can shake a Stick of Truth at. It took him eleven hours to finish the game's story and complete almost every side activity in the game.
Metal Gear Solid 5: Ground Zeroes Review;8;Great; Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes has a brief narrative, but its short length is bolstered by flexible side missions and exceptional replayability.;Peter has finished nearly every game in the Metal Gear Solid series, and spent over 15 hours playing Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes, divided between the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Xbox 360 versions of the game.
The Walking Dead: Season Two Episode 2 - A House Divided Review;8;Great; Season Two of The Walking Dead starts coming together in the bleak and harrowing second episode, A House Divided.;Brett Todd bashed zombie skulls and felt really, really sorry for Clementine while taking the two hours needed to play through this episode of The Walking Dead.
Yaiba: Ninja Gaiden Z Review;4;Poor; Scattershot action and awful writing make Yaiba: Ninja Gaiden Z one lifeless zombie invasion.;Kevin VanOrd loves Ninja Gaiden, bloody action, and crass humor, but Yaiba left him cold. He finished the campaign in about seven hours and spent about two hours squashing the undead in Arcade mode. If you're looking for some old-fashioned profanity and sexual imagery, he suggests playing MadWorld instead.
Banished Review;8;Great; Banished is a clever network of interlocking systems and mechanics that accomplish a lot with very little.;Daniel Starkey spent more than 60 hours over five days starting up over a dozen cities and struggling to keep his citizenry alive.
Towerfall Ascension Review;8;Great; Towerfall Ascension is a fast and frantic multiplayer game that provides lots of interesting variations on its enjoyable archery combat--just make sure you have a few friends on hand to ...;Maxwell McGee is relishing the fact that one-hit kills are breathing new life into the competitive brawler genre
Rambo: The Video Game Review;6;Fair; Rambo: The Video game is a fun, simple rail shooter.;Tyler Hicks usually keeps to the indoor comfort of PC gaming, but will always have a soft spot for the nostalgia of an arcade rail shooter. Countless quarters and tokens have been spent on the Time Crisis series, and a few playthroughs of Rambo: The Video Game brought back those olden times.
World of Tanks: Xbox 360 Edition Review;8;Great; Slow and strategic tank battles bring a different kind of fun to the fight in World of Tanks' multiplayer armored combat.;After taking to the skies in World of Warplanes, Nathan found that a more grounded approach to combat fit the bill nicely. He battled extensively through World of Tanks' freebie and paid content for this review.
Titanfall Review;9;Superb; Exhilarating player movement and a brilliant blend of two distinct combat styles make Titanfall a thrilling shooter.;Chris Watters played Titanfall for two days straight at a review event run by EA, where he encountered server issues allegedly caused by small player population. Over the weekend preceding publication of the GameSpot review, he played from home as the servers went up and was able to reliably enter lag-free matches in the most populated lobby. He played a dozen hours of the PC version post-release, and encountered no notable issues. He loves, loves, loves competitive shooters.
Dark Souls 2 Review;9;Superb; Dark Souls II is a terrific sequel and an amazing game in its own right, making every peek into the unknown a gut-wrenching thrill.;Kevin VanOrd played over 100 hours of Dark Souls--his favorite game of its console generation--and almost as many of Demon's Souls. He finished Dark Souls II at soul level 131 playing on a PlayStation 3 debug. While his online access was limited during this time, he was able to test various multiplayer features and can't wait to unleash hell on unsuspecting invaders.
Earth Defense Force 2025 Review;6;Fair; Earth Defense Force 2025 is shallow and unattractive. It's also good, mindless, destructive fun.;Earth Defense Force 2025 represents the first time that Carolyn has seriously dived into the EDF series. For the purposes of this review, she spent about 10 hours destroying--err, defending--Earth.
Horizon Review;6;Fair; Horizon is a strange, clumsy, and compelling composite of ideas and mechanics from many different games.;Daniel Starkey was slowly becoming a jaded strategy game veteran. Then came Horizon, and he spent dozens of hours exploring this very unusual game. He also lost a few matches for the first time in years.
Journal Review;5;Mediocre; Journal has a compelling vibe, but disjointed storytelling gets in the way of what it has to say.;Brett Todd spent just under two hours writing down all of his innermost thoughts and secrets in Journal.
Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare Review;7;Good; The gameplay of Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare is standard stuff, but the game's lighthearted tone makes it an appealing multiplayer shooter that stands out from the crowd.;Carolyn got way into Call of Duty: Modern Warfare's multiplayer years back but hasn't gotten pulled into a competitive shooter in quite a while. She spent about six hours playing Garden Warfare at an event hosted by EA, and another four hours in a scheduled online session. There is no place for a garden in her apartment building.
Outlast Review;7;Good; Outlast loses momentum occasionally, but its unsettling atmosphere and pulse-pounding chases keep pulling you along for the ride.;Carolyn isn't quite sure why she sometimes enjoys scaring herself silly, but she does. The games that have haunted her dreams include Eternal Darkness, Dead Space, and Condemned: Criminal Origins. Carolyn played the PlayStation 4 version of Outlast to completion in the empty GameSpot offices one lonely, spooky Sunday.
Thief Review;6;Fair; At its best, Thief makes you feel like a devious outlaw. Sadly, such moments are too few.;Kevin VanOrd has been sneaking in the shadows as Garrett since the release of Thief: The Dark Project. He spent about 15 hours with Thief, and reckons that he would have finished the game in eight hours or so if he'd focused on just the story.
Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 Review;7;Good; Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 starts off with a whimper, but the gripping second half of the game makes plodding through a few hours of tedium a worthwhile chore in ...;Peter's played through both the original Lords of Shadow and Mirror of Fate, and is a big fan of older games in the series. He played through Lords of Shadow 2 on the default difficulty, discovering 65 percent of the game's hidden items in the process.
Dustforce Review;7;Good; Dustforce is a delightful game that mixes its tranquil world with some seriously tough platforming.;Maxwell prides himself on cleanliness, especially when it comes to his golden locks. Thankfully, it doesn't take a team of ninja hairdressers to keep his mane clean.
Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze Review;6;Fair; Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze's unimaginative level design saps the fun out of this retro-inspired platformer.;Mark spent his Christmas break ignoring relatives and loved ones, and instead tried to earn a Platinum Trophy in Rayman: Legends. Suffice it to say, he loves a good platformer. For the purposes of this review, Mark made his way to the end of Tropical Freeze, but didn't manage to pick up all the puzzle pieces along the way.
TxK Review;8;Great; TxK is totally Tempest, but it's some of the best dang Tempest you can play.;Britton Peele's first memory of Tempest is playing the Microsoft Arcade port on his father's work PC as a youngster, and the vector visuals were burned into his brain instantly. He played through all 100 levels of TxK and chased many high scores before writing this review.
The Last of Us: Left Behind Review;9;Superb; The Last of Us: Left Behind offers an endearing look at Ellie's life before she met Joel, delivering a heartfelt story that makes an excellent character even more sympathetic.;Tom was riveted during the three hours he spent with Left Behind. He was more involved in the story of Ellie's life before she met Joel than the story of The Last of Us, and loved the changes to the combat.
Loadout Review;7;Good; Loadout's deep weapon-crafting system and outrageous violence make for boisterous fun.;Cameron Woolsey knows his way around online shooters, but shamelessly spent more time tinkering with and testing new weapons in Loadout than actually using them. For the purposes of this review, Cameron played for about 18 hours, crafting five weapons.
Jazzpunk Review;7;Good; Loads of humor and outrageousness make this cyberpunk indie adventure worth playing.;A connoisseur of peculiar indie gaming offerings, Nathan dove into Jazzpunk and got a kick out of being blasted by wave after wave of craziness. After beating the game, and then diving back in for more, he was still left craving another helping.
Toukiden: The Age of Demons Review;7;Good; Toukiden: The Age of Demons duplicates the appeal of the Monster Hunter games while also establishing its own identity.;As a fan of both Monster Hunter and Soul Sacrifice, Matt Cabral has reduced his fair share of beasties to pulpy puddles. After spending the better part of a weekend with Toukiden for the purpose of this review, his corpse pile is becoming a problem he can no longer hide in his bedroom closet.
The Castle Doctrine Review;4;Poor; The Castle Doctrine is a poorly balanced structure built on an unstable foundation.;Even after many hours of play, Nick Capozzoli clearly doesn't have the sort of nefarious criminal mind required to succeed at The Castle Doctrine's game of trap-building and armed robbery. For the purposes of this review he was killed hundreds of times by pit bulls.
Strider Review;8;Great; Strider is a high-speed, acrobatic action game with a hero that‰Ûªs fun to control from the first blade swipe to the final deathblow.;While Maxwell's familiarity with Strider doesn't extend past the Marvel vs. Capcom series, he still knows a good hack-and-slash game when he sees one. After burning through this enjoyable adventure, he is excited to go back and discover the classic games that made this character a gaming icon.
Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc Review;8;Great; Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc presents a fascinating look at the human experience, using smart storytelling to invest you in this dark and creepy world.;Tom has been fascinated by visual novels of late. Becoming a part of a clever story can be incredibly empowering. He spent a couple of dozen hours with Danganronpa and was sad to see the ending credits roll.
Strike Vector Review;7;Good; Strike Vector needs refinement, but there's a promising foundation holding up its hybridized combat.;Nick Capozzoli is a self-avowed technophile, and interested in any media with jets, robots, or any combination thereof. For the purposes of this review he played a week's worth of Strike Vector's multiplayer.
Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII Review;5;Mediocre; Lightning Returns is a jumble of mechanics and story elements that don't mesh into a meaningful whole.;Against all odds, Kevin VanOrd enjoyed Final Fantasy XIII and Final Fantasy XIII-2. He spent about 65 hours with Lightning Returns in total, and reached the final boss twice: once in a New Game Plus, and once in a New Game Plus Plus.
The Lego Movie Videogame Review;7;Good; The Lego Movie Videogame re-creates and expands on most of the film's greatest moments.;Jason Venter has played most of the Lego video games to date. He spent around seven or eight hours clearing the campaign for the purpose of this review and another few hours chasing collectibles, plus enjoyed watching the related film in 3D at the local movie theater.
Star Wars: The Old Republic - Galactic Starfighter Review;8;Great; Galactic Starfighter serves up a richly featured expansion of The Old Republic's previously bare-bones space combat experience.;Brittany Vincent is a Sith warrior who prefers to walk on the dark side of the Force. She loves dabbling in far-off alien worlds and finds your lack of faith in her disturbing. For the purposes of this review, she spent about 30 hours doing not-quite barrel rolls and cackling maniacally in the Galactic Starfighter expansion.
Insurgency Review;7;Good; No-frills realism and tight teamwork make Insurgency a welcome break from the status quo.;First-person shooters and multiplayer pew-pew are in Nathan Meunier's blood. He's been fragging dudes since the early days of home-networked Doom II matches. For this review, he spent more than a dozen hours in match after match of tactical team action.
Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition Review;8;Great; Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition is as exciting as it is gorgeous, offering a robust adventure that satisfies on almost every front.;Tom collected every hidden item when he played through Tomb Raider last year, though he unfortunately didn't have enough time to scour every environment in the Definitive Edition. Still, he was once again sucked into this incredible adventure, proving that its high placement on his Game of the Year list wasn't a mistake.
Echo Prime Review;5;Mediocre; Echo Prime offers a flawed but accessible mix of repetitive action and customization.;Jason Venter has punched, shot, and stabbed his way through so many fictional worlds that at this point he has forgotten some of them even exist. He spent 12 hours clearing the Echo Prime campaign and another four hours grinding after that, just because.
Rekoil Review;3;Bad; Rekoil harks back to online shooters of old, but game-breaking problems keep it from hitting its mark.;Cameron Woolsey spent countless hours of his youth playing games like Quake II, Unreal Tournament, and Counter-Strike, and believes that sometimes simpler can be better. But everything else has to work, too.
Fable Anniversary Review;7;Good; Not every element of Fable Anniversary holds up against its contemporaries, but it's an amusing and charming return to one of gaming's most delightful worlds.;Kevin VanOrd played and loved both the original Fable and Fable II, but was so disappointed with Fable III that he quit halfway through. He spent about 20 hours with Fable Anniversary, buying houses, getting married, and making whoopee.
Might & Magic X: Legacy Review;6;Fair; Might & Magic X: Legacy seems like a 15-year-old leftover, for better and for worse.;Veteran role player Brett Todd spent about 15 hours on might and another 15 hours on magic in the course of reviewing Might & Magic X: Legacy.
Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 Full Burst Review;5;Mediocre; Impressive visual flair cannot overcome the shallow core gameplay that plagues Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 Full Burst.;John likes to downplay his dedication to anime and Japanese video games, but the truth is that rarely a week goes by without at least a few hours being consumed by the wonders of Tokyo-driven pop culture. For the purposes of this review, 20 hours were plowed into Full Burst.
Team Fortress 2 Review;8;Great; Team Fortress 2 is an inspiring example of how great design and passionate players can keep a competitive game lively years after release.;Chris Watters reviewed Team Fortress 2 for GameSpot almost six years ago when you could buy it off of retail shelves for $20. The 12+ hours he spent for this review have been like reconnecting with an old friend who doesn't just talk about the old days, but has fun new stories and fart jokes to share.
Blackguards Review;7;Good; Blackguards is a grueling tactical role-playing game that thrives on brutal challenges.;Leif Johnson always enjoys a good fantasy RPG, and Blackguards was no different. He admits he initially wanted to kill Zurbaran, but grew to like the fellow. For the purposes of this review, he completed one full playthrough and experimented with multiple builds in shorter sessions.
Nidhogg Review;8;Great; Nidhogg isn't too satisfying alone, but it offers frantically enjoyable sword-dueling action with local friends.;Britton Peele owns more than one sword, so it's sort of surprising that he also has friends to play Nidhogg with. He was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of virtual swordfighters both online and off before writing this review, and looks forward to new challengers.
Don't Starve: Console Edition Review;7;Good; This brutal survival and crafting adventure delivers fun and punishment in equal measure.;Having already submitted to the pleasant but punishing discipline of Don't Starve on the PC, Nathan Meunier knew what he was getting into with this updated PS4 port. After many more hours spent dying, grinding, slaying, and exploring, he knows the meaning of roguelike pain. And he's ready for more.
The Wolf Among Us: Episode 2 - Smoke and Mirrors Review;7;Good; The Wolf Among Us: Episode 2 - Smoke and Mirrors is another engrossing chapter in this ongoing saga, though it doesn't blaze as brightly as the introductory episode.;After playing the first episode of The Wolf Among Us, Kevin VanOrd ran out to purchase multiple volumes of the comic that inspired it. It took him about 90 minutes to complete Smoke and Mirrors.
Octodad: Dadliest Catch Review;6;Fair; Octodad: Dadliest Catch has moments of comic brilliance, but much of it is uninspired, and it ends before it really even gets going.;Carolyn is not secretly an octopus living as a human, but her life has nonetheless taught her a thing or two about the importance of self-acceptance. She played through most of Dadliest Catch's stages twice for this review.
Pandora: First Contact Review;4;Poor; Pandora: First Contact looks to the stars, but it can't even achieve escape velocity.;Daniel Starkey has been looking for a replacement for Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri for years, and he still wishes more games included a play-by-email option. After investing a few dozen hours in it, he's ready to leave Pandora behind for greener pastures.
Consortium Review;6;Fair; Consortium is a fun story-driven sci-fi role-playing game with some first-person shooter elements, but bugs and glitches mar the experience.;Leif Johnson loves good characterization in an RPG, and Consortium presents one of the most authentic ensemble casts in a while. For the purposes of this review, he played several times to experiment with different choices.
Broken Age Act I Review;7;Good; The opening act for Broken Age establishes a wonderfully vibrant world with a surprisingly somber tone. Hopefully, it will all pay off in the second act.;Maxwell was enchanted by the whimsical and tragic world of Broken Age. He can't wait to see how it all pays off in the second act of this modern-day fairy tale.
Dr. Luigi Review;5;Mediocre; Dr. Luigi repackages the Dr. Mario formula with some new ideas, but limited options and slow pacing leave it feeling anemic.;Heidi is a longtime puzzle game player and fan of competitive gaming. Her favorite puzzle series is Magical Drop. She's rather sad that puzzle games don't have as much organized competition as other player-versus-player genres, which is why she is currently a strong advocate for promoting the Global Yoshi's Cookie League.
The Cat Lady Review;8;Great; It isn't its horror but rather its humanity that makes The Cat Lady such a worthwhile journey.;Kevin VanOrd owns only one cat, but he was still invested in The Cat Lady's titular character. He finished the game in about six hours.
OlliOlli Review;8;Great; In OlliOlli, over-the-top skateboarding gets boiled down to a high-score chase that is difficult to master but intensely rewarding.;Britton Peele's only experience with a real skateboard involved falling, but he's been a fan of over-the-top skateboard games since the early days of Tony Hawk. He mastered OlliOlli's amateur challenges, finished many pro challenges, and landed more than 1,000 perfect tricks before writing this review.
Frozen Hearth Review;3;Bad; Frozen Hearth doesn't offer anything that wasn't done better elsewhere, and long ago.;Nick Capozzoli is a capable‰ÛÓif unspectacular‰ÛÓRTS player. For the purposes of this review he played through the campaign, and against the AI in multiplayer (the servers were bereft of human players).
Assassin's Creed III: Liberation HD Review;6;Fair; Ubisoft takes a former 5-inch Assassin's Creed adventure to much larger screens and brings its baggage along with it.;Miguel previously beat Assassin's Creed III: Liberation on the Vita, which is why he managed to complete this HD version in less than six hours (with a couple more hours for side missions and general exploration). You can check out his assassin skills in GameSpot's 100 percent sync videos of Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag.
Ballpoint Universe Infinite Review;7;Good; Fanciful landscapes and imaginative enemies give Ballpoint Universe Infinite lots of quirky appeal.;
Driftmoon Review;7;Good; Driftmoon is a simple role-playing game that enraptures with clever dialogue and memorable characters.;Enthusiastic role-player Cameron Woolsey spent around 10 hours playing Driftwood, finishing the game to completion and checking out various mods.
Halo: Spartan Assault Review;6;Fair; Halo: Spartan Assault transfers adequately from mobile platforms to the Xbox One, with microtransactions in tow.;Miguel has appreciated Halo as a game series, having beaten all of the mainline installments, though he hasn't read any of the novels or comics. Clearing all 35 missions in Halo: Spartan Assault took him about five hours.
Max: The Curse of Brotherhood Review;6;Fair; Max: The Curse of Brotherhood is pretty, and pretty decent.;Jason Venter has vicariously run, jumped, crawled, and climbed his way through more worlds in peril than you'd care to know about, but he still managed to rack up more than his fair share of stumbles in the six or seven hours he spent clearing Max: The Curse of Brotherhood.
9.03m Review;5;Mediocre; 9.03m tries to stir your emotions, but its attempts to honor the dearly departed are weightless.;Kevin VanOrd has a soft spot for games, films, and novels that stimulate the heart, but believes that great art earns the right to manipulate you.
Terraria Review;9;Superb; Terraria Vita is the best version of an already amazing game because you can take this enthralling adventure with you wherever you go.;Terraria was one of Tom's favorite games of 2011, and it's even better two years later. He sunk dozens of hours into it for this review and plans on playing many dozens of hours more.
Continue?9876543210 Review;7;Good; Continue?9876543210 explores what happens to video game characters after the game-over screen fades, and in turn asks how we'll face our own mortality.;After his time with Continue, Maxwell has spent several long nights and early morning contemplating what's important in his own life. He still doesn't have all the answers, but maybe that's the point.
Violett Review;7;Good; Violett channels Salvador Dali and Tim Burton in a surreal and challenging tale.;Longtime adventurer Daniel Starkey journeyed through Violett's rabbit hole and spent two nights racking his brain to escape.
The Banner Saga Review;7;Good; More often than not, the gorgeous and intriguing Banner Saga successfully balances the conflicting ideas of strategic control and arbitrary consequence.;Kevin VanOrd enjoys leading giant armies to victory almost as much as he likes making difficult choices. He spent about 12 hours with The Banner Saga, finishing the campaign and tinkering with various decisions and their repercussions.
The Walking Dead: Season Two Episode 1 - All That Remains Review;6;Fair; All That Remains establishes characters and conflicts that may pay off in forthcoming episodes, but it doesn't stand up well on its own.;Carolyn really enjoyed the first season of Telltale's The Walking Dead. She played through All That Remains on a literal movie screen at a literal movie theater, which was absurd. Then she played through it again on a PC monitor like a normal person.
Dementium II HD Review;5;Mediocre; A serviceable survival horror, Dementium II was better with a stylus.;Matt Cabral has been a survival horror fan ever since that undead pooch pounced on him in Resident Evil. Having played both Dementium games on the Nintendo DS, he was eager to have his sanity tested again in this rerelease. After six or so hours in Dementium II HD's asylum, however, he'd rather be recommitted to the original's rubber room.
Speedball 2 HD Review;6;Fair; Speedball 2 definitely has the speed down, but the barebones multiplayer limits the fun.;This is Daniel Starkey's first experience with the Speedball series, and he has since spent far too long wondering how it would work as a real sport. He spent about 12 hours playing Speedball 2.
Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition Review;7;Good; Baldur's Gate II retains some familiar flaws, but this enhanced model is one more reason to revisit a classic role-playing game.;Dungeons & Dragons enthusiast Brett Todd dedicated a solid month of his spare time to Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn and its Throne of Bhaal expansion for the purposes of this review.
Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag - Freedom Cry Review;6;Fair; A detour for a slave-turned-pirate-turned-assassin helps sow the seeds of a rebellion in this well-intentioned but flawed add-on.;After a number of assignments, including a 100 percent sync walkthrough for GameSpot, Miguel has amassed about 100 hours in Assassin's Creed IV over multiple playthroughs. After beating the story of Freedom Cry as well as accomplishing some optional goals, the tally is up to 105 hours.
Flow Review;7;Good; Flow remains a beautifully simple blueprint for the developer's later triumphs.;Thatgamecompany's Journey ranks high on Britton Peele's list of favorite PlayStation 3 games, and he enjoys a game that can take things slowly and thoughtfully. He completed all of Flow on the PlayStation 4 and briefly revisited the PS3 version before writing this review.
Bandfuse: Rock Legends Review;7;Good; A realistic tab-based approach to rhythm game rocking makes BandFuse: Rock Legends a wailing good time despite some tough love in the learning department.;Playing in an assortment of oddball rock, punk, and metal bands since his early teens, Nathan Meunier is down with the face-melting goodness. Drums might be his instrument of choice, but he's no slouch on the six-string or low end either. For this review, he plowed through the extensive tracklist on all manner of difficulty settings, truly pushing his guitar and bass-playing skills to the limit...and then some.
X Rebirth Review;2;Terrible; X Rebirth's endless deficiencies make it an inferior husk of the X games that came before it.;Kevin VanOrd is a longtime X series lover, and longingly recalls the days when space games were common. His favorite X game remains X2: The Threat, though his favorite space game of all time is the original Homeworld. He played about 40 hours of X Rebirth for the purposes of this review.
Strength of the Sword 3 Review;6;Fair; The combat in Strength of the Sword is impressive and challenging, but boring enemies and a steep learning curve drag things down.;"Heidi laments that there are so few ""boss rush"" games on the market, and even fewer truly great games fitting that description. Hey, can I talk about Alien Soldier? I really love Alien Soldier. It's a genius game that has every kind of ultra-challenging boss you could ever--no? Well, how about I just say to play that instead?"
NES Remix Review;6;Fair; NES Remix may bring back fond memories if you've played the games it features, but it doesn't actually capture what made some of those games great in the first place.;Carolyn has an enduring love for the Nintendo Entertainment System, but even she knows that certain Nintendo-made games for it, like Urban Champion, were pretty terrible.
State of Decay: Breakdown Review;7;Good; New content may be light in this add-on, but State of Decay: Breakdown ramps up the emphasis on survival.;Leif Johnson loves open-world games, although he usually prefers to shoot arrows at trolls and bandits in The Elder Scrolls rather than bash in zombie heads. For the purposes of this review, he played about 20 hours.
Saint Seiya: Brave Soldiers Review;6;Fair; Saint Seiya: Brave Soldiers slathers lots of fan service over a simple fighting game core.;Heidi was mystified as to why Brave Soldiers was entirely in Portuguese at first, only to realize that the game defaults to that language if the console's system settings aren't English, French, Spanish, or Italian. The story mode made marginally more sense after she realized this. She is extremely thankful to know lifelong Saint Seiya fans who helped fill in the gaps.
Bravely Default Review;8;Great; Thanks to its excellent battle system, Bravely Default breathes new life into a traditionalist genre.;John's time on the 3DS is dominated by the many quality Japanese role-playing games found on the machine, and he lives in the hope that one day something even better than Chrono Trigger will come along. Over 30 hours was spent in Bravely Default's world for this review.
Tiny Brains Review;5;Mediocre; Tiny Brains is big on personality but short on intellect.;Brittany Vincent has puzzled through several PC and console adventures and considers herself well-versed in all things mind-bending. She completed Tiny Brains in both solo and cooperative modes for the purposes of this review, and though she was able to best it, that's more than she can say for her multiple playthroughs of The Secret Island of Dr. Quandary.
DUST 514 Review;4;Poor; Dust 514's bid to expand the EVE universe is an exercise in ennui.;Nick Capozzoli is a longtime EVE Online and first-person shooter player. He has spent time in Dust 514 since its beta, checking in intermittently to stay abreast of its progress.
Samurai Gunn Review;8;Great; The frenetic Samurai Gunn provides an exciting competitive experience that demands precision and rewards fast fingers and thoughtful strategies.;Tom has been aching for an exciting offline competitive game for far too long, so was immediately taken in by Samurai Gunn. He spent the majority of his time in four-player matches and rarely had much honor.
Vector Review;7;Good; Vector is an exciting free-running platformer that flies high.;Cameron Woolsey, after playing several hours of Vector, attempted to parkour over his chair and slide under a coffee table. He is happy to report he will be as good as new after a couple of weeks of intense physical therapy.
Ys: Memories of Celceta Review;8;Great; Well-constructed action and exploration make Ys: Memories of Celceta a delightful adventure.;After The Oath in Felghana and Ys Seven, Heidi was greatly looking forward to Memories of Celceta. After 25 hours with the newest YS game, she's happy that Falcom's first Vita game delivered the goods. She'll still argue that Ys I and II are pretty awful to play by modern standards, though.
Darkout Review;5;Mediocre; Its problems add up quickly, but there's enjoyment in Darkout's more advanced crafting systems if you dig deeply enough into them .;Britton Peele has mined many depths and crafted many items, and is always up for some relaxing exploration. He spent more than 20 hours fumbling for a torch in Darkout for this review.
Gomo Review;5;Mediocre; Gomo has heart, but its brevity and lack of challenge keep it from being worth your while.;Cameron Woolsey travelled far and wide to reunite a burlap boy with his burlap dog, playing less than two hours in the process and unlocking two bonus games.
Huntsman: The Orphanage Review;6;Fair; Story and voice work trump dwindling fear in Huntsman: The Orphanage.;Leif Johnson lives in Illinois, but he's never had the occasion to discover a ruined orphanage quite like the one found in The Huntsman, though he has explored his fair share of abandoned buildings blighted by urban decay. He thinks the huntsman would have been even more effective if set in snow. For the purposes of this review, Leif played about eight hours.
Luxuria Superbia Review;5;Mediocre; Luxuria Superbia momentarily kindles your fire, but quickly loses energy.;Cameron Woolsey spent the later part of Luxuria Superbia trying not to get distracted by shiny objects. For the purpose of this review, Cameron played each stage to completion.
World of Warplanes Review;7;Good; A ton of unlockable planes and exciting dogfights overshadow World of Warplanes' tendency towards repetition.;Nathan Meunier is no stranger to the unfriendly skies. From bombing runs to dogfights, he's been locking and loading in the cockpit since the early days of the flight combat genre. For this review, he tested out lots of different planes and engaged the enemy in more than 85 matches.
Dead Sky Review;2;Terrible; Dead Sky merges tower defense and zombie action into one terrible mess.;Tyler Hicks typically defends towers in League of Legends but took a break to instead defend himself in Dead Sky. He's now in the top 20 on the leaderboards for single-player attempts on every map in Dead Sky.
Super Motherload Review;7;Good; Super Motherload offers a peaceful respite from the cacophony of civilization.;Tom has developed a close relationship with digging in recent years. From the expansive worlds of Terraria to the robotic plunders in SteamWorld Dig, he seems to continually wield a digital shovel. He spent seven hours digging into Super Motherload and was stymied by many of its puzzles.
Blacklight: Retribution Review;5;Mediocre; There's fast-paced fun to be had in Blacklight: Retribution, but its demanding free-to-play model dulls the sheen.;Nathan Meunier is no stranger to the Blacklight series and is an avid enjoyer of the first-person shooter. For the purposes of this review, he spent upward of a dozen hours killing and getting killed in countless online matches.
Adventure Time: Explore the Dungeon Because I DON'T KNOW Review;2;Terrible; Adventure Time: Explore the Dungeon Because I DON'T KNOW is a terrible excuse for a dungeon crawler with nothing to offer anyone.;"Carolyn has been playing dungeon crawlers since the days when ""Warrior needs food badly!"" could be heard echoing throughout arcades across the land. She thinks this might be the worst dungeon crawler she's ever played."
Fighter Within Review;2;Terrible; Fighter Within is a laughable attempt at a fighting game.;Mark completed the story mode of Fighter Within for this review, and took on some of his coworkers in two-player combat. He wishes both things had never happened to him.
Peggle 2 Review;8;Great; Peggle 2 is an engrossing explosion of sights, sounds, and laughs.;Mark has played the original Peggle relentlessly on his iPhone nearly every day for the past two years. He's not quite sure how many hours that adds up to, but he knows from all the virtual Peggle trophies he has that it was totally worth it.
The Novelist Review;7;Good; The Novelist doesn't tell the most tightly constructed of stories, but the choices it forces you to make have real, affecting weight.;Carolyn once entertained notions of being a novelist, but is perhaps more of a playwright at heart. She played through The Novelist twice for this review. It took her about six hours in all.
Gran Turismo 6 Review;7;Good; Gran Turismo 6 celebrates the series' great legacy, but stutters toward the checkered flag.;Joseph Barron is a virtual speed demon who'd rather have a bucket seat in his living room than an armchair. He has played hundreds of hours of every Gran Turismo game, but ever since GT3 on the PS2, he's always disappointed when the new game doesn't feature the early 2000s British rocker Feeder on the soundtrack.
Two Brothers Review;7;Good; Two Brothers seems like just another nostalgia trip, but it hides more than its share of poignant secrets.;Being a child of the '90s, Daniel Starkey spent far too much time with his face glued to a handheld. Glitched playtime notwithstanding, he also spent about 12 hours with Two Brothers over the course of four days.
Doki-Doki Universe Review;7;Good; Doki-Doki Universe is a simple game that uses humor and eccentricity to carry its warmhearted message.;Shaun McInnis was smiling like an idiot the entire time he played Doki-Doki Universe. To be fair, that's the only way he knows how to smile, but his dentist is currently working on that.
AquaPazza: AquaPlus Dream Match Review;7;Good; You probably won't recognize any of its crossover characters, but Aquapazza is still an engaging, fun fighter.;Heidi's curiosity about Aquapazza was piqued upon seeing it played during the Japanese Tougeki fighting game championship at Tokyo Game Show 2011. She became fully experienced with Aquapazza's mechanics and observed high-level play. Out of all the game's cast, Karulau is the strongest candidate to be her waifu.
FIFA 2014 Review;8;Great; Improved player movement and fantastic stadium atmosphere ensure the quintessential FIFA 14 experience.;Danny's passion for football games started with Sensible World of Soccer on the Amiga 600. He supported Pro Evolution during its glory days but made the switch to FIFA in 2009. He now uses the FIFA series to imagine a world where Arsenal actually win trophies.
Mario Party: Island Tour Review;7;Good; If you're looking for on-the-go minigame mayhem, Mario Party: Island Tour is an enjoyable sojourn.;Heidi has been reviewing a lot of the minigame collections being released for the holidays and thinks Island Tour is one of the better picks in the genre right now. Everyone has played a Mario Party game at some point in their life, but Heidi has thought way, way too hard about what makes a minigame collection work. Jeez, will you stop thinking and just roll the dice already?
SimCity: Cities of Tomorrow Review;5;Mediocre; Cities of Tomorrow doesn't add much to the deeply flawed SimCity aside from Blade Runner visuals.;Longtime city-builder and real-life mayor Brett Todd moved his life about 15 hours into the future while playing SimCity: Cities of Tomorrow for the purposes of this review.
Redshirt Review;6;Fair; While Redshirt is a funny and clever sim that allows for interesting relationships, it can occasionally be as mindless as the social networks it parodies.;Britton Peele has boldly gone deep into many life simulations, including a period of time when he reviewed little but expansion packs for The Sims 3. Over the course of 10 hours, Britton escaped Redshirt's space station twice.
Ryse: Son of Rome Review;4;Poor; Ryse: Son of Rome looks the part, but underneath its pretty exterior lies a shallow, mind-numbingly tedious action game.;Mark loves a good action game, having reviewed the likes of DmC: Devil May Cry and God of War: Ascension. He somehow willed himself to play Ryse through to completion, and spent an evening hammering through some multiplayer on Xbox Live.
Zoo Tycoon Review;6;Fair; Zoo Tycoon's animals are adorable, but a clunky interface prevents this management sim from reaching its potential.;"Carolyn hasn't spent much time playing management simulations, and Zoo Tycoon is her first game with the word ""Tycoon"" in the title. However, she has been to the San Diego Zoo Safari Park many times, and has a particular fondness for capybaras."
Madden 25 Review;7;Good; The definitive versions of Madden NFL 25 excel on subtlety.;Miguel's charmed upbringing as a San Francisco native in the 1980s makes him expect a lot from his beloved Niners, virtual or otherwise. In 4th grade, he tackled the QB, not realizing it was a flag football game. The longtime Madden player has since gotten better at understanding the rules, leading to about 30 combined hours on both the Xbox One and PS4 versions.
EVE Online Review;8;Great; EVE Online is one of the most unique and challenging MMORPGs running.;Nick Capozzoli has been a pirate, a carebear, a soldier, a scavenger, a miner, and a wanderer in the EVE universe since 2005. For this review, he leveraged those experiences and a brief refresher stint.
Powerstar Golf Review;7;Good; Powerstar Golf sticks to tried-and-true methods to deliver a reliably enjoyable take on the sport.;It's been many years since Carolyn has played a golf video game, and even longer since she's been on an actual golf course. She spent upward of a dozen hours on Powerstar Golf's four courses.
LocoCycle Review;6;Fair; Its situations and story are riotous, but LocoCycle can't translate its fun humor into fun gameplay.;Kevin VanOrd likes when games bring the funny, and has played and enjoyed numerous Twisted Pixel games, 'Splosion Man and The Maw in particular. It took him about two hours to finish LocoCycle, at which point he returned to check out the various unlockables and other difficulty levels.
Deadfall Adventures Review;3;Bad; Deadfall Adventures is a boring, glitchy, and repetitive shooter with too few moments of clarity.;Cameron Woolsey, a longtime fan of adventuring into the wilds, knows all that glitters is not gold
Super Mario 3D World Review;9;Superb; Super Mario 3D World is a sublime platformer that's full of wonderful ideas and fabulous level design.;Mark spent many a week planning out the perfect route through the Grandmaster Galaxy in Mario Galaxy 2, and still regards it as one of his greatest achievements. He played Super Mario 3D World through to completion, and fiercely fought the urge to try to collect all the green stars on his way there.
Dead Rising 3 Review;7;Good; Dead Rising 3 has a lot of fun encouraging you to use its impressive array of barmy, brutal weaponry in an undead city.;Martin played Dead Rising 3 for 18 hours on both Normal and Nightmare mode, but could not test the game's SmartGlass features as they were not available at time of writing. He is determined to one day obtain the 7 Day Survivor Achievement in the original Dead Rising, and delighted to report that 17,298 zombies were harmed in the making of the review.
Risk of Rain Review;8;Great; Risk of Rain brings roguelike elements to a challenging 2D platformer that glorifies the item hunt.;Cameron Woolsey is a veteran roguelike player and spent about eight hours playing Risk of Rain to completion, unlocking five characters in the process.
Tearaway Review;8;Great; Tearaway's blend of the real and virtual worlds makes it a rare and charming treat.;Regularly on the road, John is an enthusiastic Vita player with extensive experience with the handheld. From Mario to Rayman, he has been consumed by platformers for longer than he cares to admit and completed the game twice for this review.
SimCity Review: A Real Mayor's Perspective Review;4;Poor; SimCity has a lot of flaws, one of which is an extremely unrealistic depiction of what it's like to sit in a mayor's chair.;Brett Todd is a longtime city-building enthusiast--not to mention, the mayor of an actual town in Ontario, Canada. He spent the equivalent of five or six real-life council meetings wearing a virtual chain of office in SimCity. That's around 20 hours, give or take a motion or two.
Crimson Dragon Review;5;Mediocre; Crimson Dragon attempts to bring on-rails shooters into the modern era, but fails to recreate the genre's classic straightforward action in the process.;Panzer Dragoon is one of Peter's favorite Sega franchises, and the great Star Fox 64 sits snugly in the Nintendo 64 on his desk. He played through the entire story for this review, and evolved the default dragon all the way to its ultimate form in the process.
Killer Instinct Review;7;Good; Killer Instinct successfully updates the '90s classic into a competitive fighter that can enter the ring with the genre's regulars.;Maxwell is a long-time fighting game fan who was banned from playing the original Killer Instinct. He was excited to finally fill this gap in his fighting game knowledge, but is still trying to land the coveted double-ultra combo.
NBA Live 14 Review;4;Poor; NBA Live 14 struggles in just about every facet, resulting in an unsatisfying and frustrating version of basketball.;Tom's adoration of NBA basketball was almost killed by NBA Live 14. He spent a dozen hours in the various modes and had only one loss in six online matches.
Forza Motorsport 5 Review;9;Superb; Forza's love for all things fast is more infectious than ever in this exquisite racing sim.;Shaun McInnis learned to drive using his mother's Ford Aerostar minivan and has been compensating for it with racing video games ever since. His driver level currently stands at 48 and counting, having played mostly on the highly skilled drivatar difficulty level.
Flower Review;8;Great; Flower remains a ravishing display of nature's grace.;Kevin has enjoyed each of thatgamecompany's peaceful games, and Journey is one of his favorite games of the entire console generation. He played the PlayStation 4 version of Flower twice for the purposes of this review.
Blood of the Werewolf Review;7;Good; Blood of the Werewolf is a fun and challenging platformer that pays homage to Hollywood's classic movie monsters.;Cameron Woolsey is a fan of playing platformers and shouting colorful expletives. Blood of the Werewolf let him live the dream of doing both at once. For the purposes of this review, Cameron played about seven hours, taking occasional breaks to fix his keyboard and quietly sob to himself.
Killzone: Shadow Fall Review;7;Good; Killzone: Shadow Fall's multiplayer plays to the series' key strengths. It's too bad the campaign forgot to turn on the heat.;Kevin VanOrd has played every console Killzone game to completion, and thinks Killzone 2 is the most underregarded shooter gem of its generation. (He also thinks Killzone 2 has the best flamethrower ever.) He played the Shadow Fall campaign in the GameSpot office, and it took about 8 hours, give or take. He played numerous online multiplayer sessions at Sony's offices.
Sound Shapes Review;9;Superb; Sound Shapes is a singular experience that uses the power of music to elevate its enthralling platforming.;Tom has never been gifted musically, so he seeks out people who can fill that empty place in his heart. He is thankful that Sound Shapes exists, considering how important both music and platforming are to him. Tom played through Sound Shapes in a few glorious hours, and then designed his own stage before checking out what the community had created.
Contrast Review;5;Mediocre; Wonky physics and prosaic puzzles prevent Contrast from making the most of its intriguing concept and intoxicating atmosphere.;Carolyn loves Casablanca and dreams of spending smoky nights in elegant jazz clubs but has not yet been to Europe. She played through the PlayStation 4 version of Contrast at the GameSpot offices. It took her about four hours.
Knack Review;4;Poor; Dull combat with little diversity banishes Knack to a dark realm normally reserved for the likes of foul goblins.;Colorful adventures are where Tom wishes he could spend just about all of his gaming time. Tom played through a finished build of the game and it took roughly 10 hours.
The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds Review;9;Superb; The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds is packed full of enough canny puzzles and clever dungeons to make the experience feel as fresh as its iconic predecessor.;Martin Gaston has been playing Zelda games for most of his life. His favorite is Ocarina of Time, but A Link to the Past is definitely in the top three.
Morphopolis Review;6;Fair; It's a pleasure to exist in Morphopolis' gorgeous spaces. Making your way through them proves less inviting.;Kevin VanOrd has been immersing himself in grand adventures since he first journeyed through the original Zork. He played Morphopolis twice for the purposes of this review, expending about 85 minutes in the process.
Warface Review;6;Fair; Warface brings tons of visual shine to the free-to-play space, but this generic first-person shooter doesn't go far beyond the basics.;Nathan Meunier has been a first-person shooter enthusiast since the genre's early days of Doom and Duke Nukem 3D. For the purposes of this review, he spent around 10 hours busting virtual caps in strangers across tons of co-op and competitive matches.
Journey of a Roach Review;7;Good; The short but sweet Journey of a Roach presents a charming postapocalyptic world.;Britton Peele has had many an adventure pointing and clicking. He has sailed with Guybrush Threepwood and taken a long journey to Arcadia. Surprisingly, his experience with roaches that invade his house didn't help much in completing Journey of a Roach, which he did twice for this review.
XCOM: Enemy Within Review;8;Great; XCOM: Enemy Within is a feature-packed expansion that makes a great game even greater.;Leif Johnson has employed turn-based tactics against gangsters and aggressive superpowers in games like Omerta and Valkyria Chronicles, but he's always found XCOM's tale of guns and aliens the best fit for the concept. For the purposes of this review, Leif played about 27 hours.
Stick It to the Man Review;7;Good; A clever tale of a man, a pink spaghetti arm emerging from his head, and a quest for justice.;Chris Barylick has never had a pink spaghetti arm floating out of his head, but the day is still young. He grew up loving puzzle games like Maniac Mansion and Day of the Tentacle and spent approximately 12 hours playing Stick It to the Man to completion on a debug PlayStation 3.
NBA 2K14 Review;8;Great; NBA 2K14 uses its incredible visual design to draw you in, and the top-notch action is closer than ever to the real thing.;Tom has been infatuated with basketball since he was old enough to dribble a basketball. Although he doesn't spent much of his free time playing basketball games, he spent hours glued to the television for this review. He spent most of his time in My Career and a bit in My GM as well.
BioShock Infinite: Burial at Sea - Episode 1 Review;5;Mediocre; BioShock Infinite's mechanics don't play nicely with the underwater city of Rapture in Burial at Sea - Episode 1.;Kevin VanOrd is an unabashed BioShock Infinite lover, and completed Burial at Sea - Episode 1 twice. His first playthrough was on the Xbox 360 at the San Francisco offices of a PR agency. He later played the PC version in the GameSpot offices.
Need for Speed: Rivals Review;8;Great; Need for Speed: Rivals smartly builds on the strong foundation of its predecessors to deliver an aggressive arcade racer that bristles with energy.;Carolyn was introduced to the thrills of wrecking her rivals in Criterion's racing classic, Burnout 3: Takedown. She spent four hours playing Need for Speed: Rivals at a multiplayer event organized by EA and played for many more hours in the GameSpot offices.
Valhalla Knights 3 Review;3;Bad; Awful combat, persistent load times, and a host of ever-building annoyances make Valhalla Knights 3 a miserable slog.;"Heidi loves a good RPG... the operative word here being ""good,"" which Valhalla Knights 3 is most definitely not. She tried her best to wring fun out of this game, as she has with previous Valhalla Knights, but the game failed to deliver over the 30 hours it took to finish."
Path of Exile Review;9;Superb; Where action role-playing games are concerned, Path of Exile is as good as they come.;Kevin VanOrd has clicked his way through countless role-playing games. Dungeon Siege 2 has always been his enduring favorite in the genre, but Path of Exile may have replaced it. For the purposes of this review, Kevin played about 50 hours.
Intake Review;8;Great; Intake is a frenetic shooter that does a great job capturing the euphoria of modern electronic music.;A semi-active raver, Dan Starkey knows a few things about flashing lights and pulsing bass, and he could not stop playing this addictive light-gun-style arcade shooter.
Resogun Review;8;Great; Resogun takes a classic formula and supercharges every aspect, culminating in a game that challenges your reflexes and dazzles you with its explosive presentation.;Peter's a hardcore shoot-em-up player with years of experience with the genre, and he blasted his way through the first two difficulties for this review.
Ratchet & Clank: Into the Nexus Review;8;Great; Ratchet & Clank: Into the Nexus packs a lot of joyful action and hysterical dialogue into its short running time.;Cameron Woolsey has made few things better by hitting them with wrenches, but that doesn't stop him from trying. For the purpose of this review, Cameron has played the game to full completion, spending around 15 hours going through normal and Challenge modes.
Final Exam Review;5;Mediocre; Final Exam provides sufficient cause to once again do everything you've already done before.;Brawler lover Jason Venter has seen enough television shows to know that high school reunions always end badly, but he still spent over five hours clearing the campaign with a friend and messing around some more all on his lonesome.
Forced Review;5;Mediocre; Forced offers friends a unique cooperative brawler, but only if they can connect.;Jason Venter lost himself in challenging arena battles and in matchmaking menus for more than a dozen hours, conquered numerous trials, and still cringes at the sight of a horde of swarmers.
Infinity Blade III Review;6;Fair; There's a fun fighting system in Infinity Blade III, but it isn't enough to carry this unnecessarily bloated adventure.;Mark has been on the mobile games bandwagon since the launch of the App Store, and reviewed the excellent Infinity Blade II. He sunk around 10-hours of his commuting time into Infinity Blade III for this review.
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures Review;5;Mediocre; Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures is merely competent, but a surreal undercurrent does make you think differently about the pellet eater.;Tom longs for the days when 3D platformers ruled the retail shelves. Pac-Man never appealed to him during his formative years, but he grew to love the yellow guy when Championship Edition and DX came out. It took roughly 10 hours to see all of Pacopolis, and he roped in three coworkers to play multiplayer during which fellow editor Chris Watters claimed a resounding victory.
Lego Marvel Super Heroes Review;7;Good; Lego Marvel Super Heroes charms at every turn with its varied content and tongue-in-cheek attitude.;Chris Barylick has every intention of unlocking 100% of this game's content, if only to fight the forces of evil with Aunt May and her umbrella.
The Harvest Review;3;Bad; The Harvest is short, forgettable, and tedious.;Brett Todd has spent untold hours on his PC playing the roles he was destined to play, and was mighty glad The Harvest only added a few more hours to that total.
The Guided Fate Paradox Review;5;Mediocre; The Guided Fate Paradox provides a near limitless amount of content. The problem is that most of it isn't all that interesting.;When it comes to strategy games, Maxwell prefers turn-based to real-time. Final Fantasy Tactics sits high atop that list, but he also enjoyed La Pucelle: Tactics and the early Disgaea games, dood! After pouring almost 50 hours in Paradox, he fears for his eternal soul.
Castlevania: Lords of Shadow - Mirror of Fate HD Review;8;Great; Castlevania: Lords of Shadow - Mirror of Fate HD improves upon the original release by upgrading the visuals and stripping out unnecessary quick-time events.;Peter's a glutton for Castlevania games and despiser of superfluous quick-time events. After completing the 3DS version, he played eight hours of Castlevania: Lords of Shadow - Mirror of Fate HD on the Xbox 360 for this review.
How to Survive Review;7;Good; How to Survive doesn't push any boundaries, and it ends sooner than it should, but it does have a decent amount of solid play punctuated by bursts of excellence.;An experienced killer of zombies, Daniel Starkey learned how to survive and tackled the undead hordes.
WRC 4: FIA World Rally Championship Review;6;Fair; WRC 4 continues this series' regular improvements with challenging and satisfying driving, but remains a largely unremarkable off-road racer.;Joseph Barron is a master of speed...in his living room. He's the sort of guy who owns three sim-racing steering wheels, but doesn't have an actual car. He prefers his racing cars with big wings and open wheels, but he's pretty good at going sideways in virtual mud too.
WWE 2K14 Review;6;Fair; WWE 2K14 sports impressive presentation that faithfully recreates the best moment in WrestleMania history, but that doesn't make the act of wrestling any more exciting.;After spending hours with the likes of WWF Royal Rumble and Wrestlefest growing up, Tom hasn't touched a wrestling game in years. Tom spent most of his time in WrestleMania mode, though he went online and tinkered with the creation elements as well.
Football Manager 2014 Review;9;Superb; Football Manager 2014 is the most exhaustive, most approachable entry in the series to date.;John Robertson has lost far too many hours, over far too many years, playing Football Manager. With 50 hours of playing clocked up for this review, he has still failed to return Portsmouth to the Premier League.
Mario & Sonic at the Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games Review;5;Mediocre; Mario & Sonic's latest outing has the occasional fun moment, but fails to secure a podium finish.;Martin Gaston has been known to enjoy a good collection of minigames late on a Friday night, and as a child loved Sonic the Hedgehog more than life itself. He played this latest collection of Olympic Winter games for 10 hours, forcing friends and coworkers to join in.
Call of Duty: Ghosts Review;8;Great; With an outstanding new co-op mode and a campaign fueled by fierce combat, Call of Duty: Ghosts is another great addition to the blockbuster shooter franchise.;Shaun McInnis has played every Call of Duty campaign to date, but his fondest memory of the series is the chaotic joy of 18-player Domination matches on Modern Warfare's tiny Shipment map. He played Ghosts at a review event in Southern California. Travel was paid for by Activision.
Batman: Arkham Origins Review;6;Fair; Batman: Arkham Origins relies much too heavily on familiar mechanics, making it a mechanically solid but uninspired adventure.;Carolyn's favorite Batman book is Year One. Her favorite Batman actor is Michael Keaton. Her favorite Batman games are Batman: Arkham City and Batman for the NES.
Angry Birds Star Wars Review;6;Fair; The mobile classic comes to consoles, but at a much higher price.;Chris Barylick has loved, lived and breathed Star Wars pretty much since he was a fetus. And he'll never get those weeks of his life he spent camping out for the prequels back. He played around 10 hours of Angry Birds Star Wars for the purposes of this review.
Batman: Arkham Origins Blackgate Review;5;Mediocre; Batman's latest portable adventure falls on its face due to a bevy of design issues that are too glaring to ignore.;Peter has a soft spot in his heart for Super Metroid and Sunsoft's pair of Batman games on the NES, and he's fairly certain Michael Keaton is, in fact, Bruce Wayne.
Eldritch Review;7;Good; Eldritch starts strong with tense gameplay and great exploration, but loses its way before the end.;Cameron Woolsey has spent many years hiding in the shadows searching for keys and mystical artifacts, and believes that torches are for novices. For the purposes of this review, Cameron played each stage multiple times, though a few of those playthroughs happened because he forgot to watch his back.
Battlefield 4 Review;8;Great; Battlefield 4's diverse and deadly multiplayer battles once again deliver exhilarating action, while the single-player campaign struggles to find its footing.;Chris Watters has spent hundreds of hours in Battlefields past and still can't fly a jet very well. For this review, he played the PlayStation 4 and PC versions at a multi-day review event at EA, then went on to play PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3 versions at home with copies provided by EA.
Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Review;9;Superb; Easily the most ambitious Assassin's Creed game in years, Black Flag is an outstanding adventure by any standard.;Shaun McInnis can spend hours explaining why Assassin's Creed II is his favorite game in the series, but Black Flag gives it a real run for its money. He played the PlayStation 4 version to completion over a period of several days at Ubisoft's San Francisco office. Current-gen versions were later played in GameSpot's office.
Solstice Arena Review;8;Great; Solstice Arena is speedy, engaging, and terrifically fun.;Tyler Hicks is preparing for the inevitable zom-MOBA apocalypse by hoarding all the free-to-play MOBA currencies he can find. He power-leveled to Solstice level 85 in a week.
Professor Layton and the Azran Legacy Review;7;Good; Professor Layton and the Azran Legacy has some neat puzzles and some great new minigames, but fails to step outside its comfort zone.;Lucy Ingram is an aficionado of puzzling adventure games and loves a bit of a challenge. She has followed the Professor Layton series from the onset of The Curious Village and is always eager for the next opportunity to stimulate her mind.
Just Dance 2014 Review;7;Good; There's not much new to see in Just Dance 2014, but it remains one of the most accessible and stupidly fun party games around.;Mark has reviewed nearly every dancing game that has been thrown GameSpot's way. Sadly, despite such experience, he remains absolutely terrible at dancing.
Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Dual Destinies Review;8;Great; Dual Destinies rises above its expected trappings to offer a witty and insightful look at the nature of truth.;Tom has been enamored with the legal system since Colonel Jessup argued that Lieutenant Kaffee couldn't handle the truth. A veteran of the Phoenix Wright franchise, Tom contends that the last case in Trials and Tribulations is the best writing ever seen in a video game.
Wii Party U Review;5;Mediocre; There's plenty in this package, but Wii Party U's bland presentation and inconsistent game quality can take the air out of a social gaming experience.;Heidi is a firm believer that quality local multiplayer game design is an art form. She played through every single one of Wii Party U's minigames and recruited local friends to play through other modes with her. She also profusely apologizes to them for any long-term damage to their marriages as a result of said play.
Dark Matter Review;4;Poor; Style trumps substance in sci-fi survival horror side-scroller Dark Matter.;Matt Cabral has never met a derelict spaceship he didn't want to explore
Glare Review;6;Fair; Glare needed more substance to truly shine.;Jason Venter has enjoyed platformers ever since he took his first steps in the Mushroom Kingdom in 1988. He devoted several hours to Glare, time enough to finish the campaign and goof around in his favorite stages.
Rocksmith 2014 Edition Review;8;Great; Rocksmith 2014 is a vast improvement on its predecessor, and a valuable learning tool for any aspiring guitar player.;Mark has been playing guitar for the best part of 12 years, during which time he has spent an absurd amount of money collecting instruments, and drove every girlfriend he ever had to insanity with his endless practicing. He regrets nothing.
Iesabel Review;6;Fair; Iesabel gives you a cheap and quirky Diablo knockoff.;Brett Todd is more of a hacker than a slasher, although he's willing to be talked into either for a good loot drop. Over 20 hours of all of the above went into this review.
Bionic Dues Review;7;Good; Bionic Dues is a roguelike that looks like a rookie but plays like a pro.;Leif Johnson has been playing roguelikes for quite some time
The Stanley Parable Review;9;Superb; The Stanley Parable is simultaneously a brilliant exploration of the nature of choice in games and a wonderfully entertaining game in its own right.;Carolyn likes to venture off the beaten path in life as well as in games, but unfortunately, the narrator in her head isn't nearly as witty as the one in The Stanley Parable.
Deus Ex: Human Revolution - Director's Cut Review;8;Great; An absorbing world and minor but meaningful improvements make Deus Ex: Human Revolution - The Director's Cut a winning revival.;Kevin VanOrd will never forget his first glimpse of the New York skyline in the original Deus Ex, and thinks Deus Ex: Invisible War gets a bad rap. He played the Director's Cut to completion, but not before hacking into every computer terminal he could find.
Skylanders Swap Force Review;7;Good; Skylanders Swap Force is an expensive habit, but the game is so charming and fun that you'll be compelled to keep adding to your collection of cute figurines.;Chris Barylick was born in the late '70s and spent way too much time playing platform and adventure games in the '80s and '90s. He continues to obsess over the Lego Star Wars games and will happily go back to collect more coins to unlock a cool new ship, if available.
140 Review;7;Good; 140 successfully blends crisp visuals with a rhythmic soundtrack in an engaging and challenging 2D platformer.;Cameron Woolsey has spent the better part of his 20-year video game career hopping platforms and collecting keys. He still scours the Internet daily for his next retro purchase. For the purposes of this review, Cameron played through the game twice, though he is still unsure how he beat that third boss.
Montague's Mount Review;2;Terrible; Montague's Mount takes a few respectable ideas and then wholly obscures them.;Daniel Starkey is a fan of well-paced, slow-building psychological horror, but suffered through Montague's Mount so that he could see its conclusion.
Full Bore: The First Dig Review;7;Good; Full Bore's open world of puzzles is fun to explore, though it doesn't always offer incentive to solve everything.;Britton Peele has never been a boar, but he has always had a fondness for solving puzzles and for digging holes haphazardly. He uncovered roughly 65 percent of the secrets hidden underground and reached the end of the game before writing this review.
Blue Estate Prologue Review;3;Bad; Blue Estate Prologue's gross humor overshadows its few merits as a game.;Kevin VanOrd likes a good dirty joke and a titillating nip slip now and again. He completed Blue Estate Prologue twice on two difficulty settings. It wasn't any funnier the second time.
Salvation Prophecy Review;5;Mediocre; Salvation Prophecy is a charming space sim, but it lacks gravity.;Tyler Hicks has taken over the helm of the Salvation, and brought peace to all factions to stifle the alien threat.
Sonic Lost World Review;5;Mediocre; Sonic Lost World is a confused and derivative platformer that struggles to make the most of its speedy blue star.;Mark spent much of his youth chasing down Chaos Emeralds, just so he could turn a blue hedgehog yellow. He also considers Sonic & Knuckles' lock-on cartridge gaming's greatest technological achievement.
Grand Theft Auto V Review - Southland Sprawl Review;8;Great; Grand Theft Auto V is a great game. But it too often erects roadblocks when you just want to be a catalyst for chaos.;Brett Todd loves the GTA series, and untold hours of his life have gone into playing GTAs III through V.
Knock-knock Review;4;Poor; Knock-knock's unnerving atmosphere threatens to terrify, but there's nothing scary about its dull hide-and-seek gameplay.;Carolyn's been scaring herself silly with video games since she first played Haunted House for the Atari 2600. She played Knock-knock alone in the dark, empty, creepy GameSpot offices late one night.
Irritum Review;4;Poor; Irritum blends puzzle platforming with philosophical musings, but neither element will keep you rooted in this barren world.;Chris Watters relishes the precise hops and soaring leaps of a challenging platformer, though he usually doesn't seek to attain 100 percent completion. He completed 31 out of Irritum's 40 levels, collecting 47 out of 76 memories along the way.
The Wolf Among Us: Episode 1 Review - Testing My Faith Review;6;Fair; The characters and intrigue of Fables are well-represented, but something is amiss in The Wolf Among Us.;From the tropical seas to the snarky suburbs to the zombie apocalypse, Chris Watters is the veteran of many Telltale Games adventures. He likes finding a way to fit in to new roles and new worlds, and generally plays nice with his new virtual friends.
Rune Factory 4 Review;7;Good; Farming meets dungeon adventuring as this Harvest Moon spin-off makes good in its first foray onto the 3DS.;"As with many N64 owners in 1999, Miguel‰Ûªs Harvest Moon ""gateway"" installment was Harvest Moon 64. As much as he enjoys the franchise, Miguel would not have approved of Rune Factory had it been a mere Harvest Moon medieval reskin. The 55 hours he spent on Rune Factory 4 flew by unexpectedly."
Rise of Venice Review;7;Good; Have a little patience with some of Rise of Venice‰Ûª's quirks, and you will soon enjoy forging a trading empire on the seas of the Renaissance-era Mediterranean.;Brett Todd thinks only suckers pay retail, although he doesn‰Ûª't mind paying a few bucks for a good economic sim. He sailed the high seas buying low and selling high for about 25 hours for the purposes of this review.
Disgaea D2: A Brighter Darkness Review;8;Great; Disgaea D2: A Brighter Darkness is one of the funniest and freshest role-playing games of the year.;Heidi is a strategy RPG fanatic whose personal record for most time spent on a Disgaea title is 250-plus hours of Disgaea 2. For the purposes of this review, she put 45 hours into Disgaea D2, the majority of which was spent futzing with the Item World and finding ways to exploit the detailed gameplay mechanics.
Prime World Review;6;Fair; Prime World tries to innovate on the base MOBA gameplay, but lacks soul.;"Tyler Hicks likes to wave his cane at new MOBA games, recalling tales of ""his day"" when the StarCraft map Aeon of Strife and its spin-offs were the only creep-slaying game modes around. For this review, he reached Castle level 13 and played about 25 hours."
A.R.E.S. Extinction Agenda EX Review;6;Fair; A.R.E.S. Extinction Agenda EX is a generally satisfying homage to a beloved action franchise.;Jason Venter has repeatedly cleared most Mega Man X games, and still loves a good platformer. He spent around 6 hours clearing both A.R.E.S. campaigns for the purposes of this review.
League of Legends Review;9;Superb; League of Legends is a free-to-play multiplayer phenomenon that has cemented itself as the cornerstone of its genre.;"Tyler Hicks likes to wave his cane at new-coming MOBA titles, recalling tales of ""his day"" when the StarCraft map Aeon of Strife and its spin-offs were the only creep-slaying game modes around. He's played several hundred hours of League of Legends, and has no plans to stop anytime soon."
The Wolf Among Us: Episode 1 - Faith Review;8;Great; The heavyhearted first episode of The Wolf Among Us fully cloaks you in its bloody mystery.;"Kevin VanOrd wasn't intimately familiar with the Fables universe until he started playing The Wolf Among Us, at which point he voraciously started consuming the comics. For this review, he played the episode three times, making different choices each time. However, he still has one playthrough he considers ""his,"" and looks forward to seeing the tale through to its conclusion."
Grand Theft Auto Online Review;7;Good; Grand Theft Auto Online often rises above its troubles to become a delightfully diverse open-world escapade.;Carolyn has been a huge fan of the Grand Theft Auto games ever since she hit the streets of Liberty City in GTA III. She is definitely not currently wanted by police in 17 states.
The Walking Dead: 400 Days - A Noble Experiment Review;7;Good; While inconsistent as a whole, The Walking Dead: 400 Days provides a few terrific snapshots into the experiences of those surviving the zombie apocalypse.;Shaun McInnis is a veteran of the zombie apocalypse and Telltale's The Walking Dead ranks as one of his all-time favorites in the genre. He would prefer to pretend that The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct never existed.
Beyond: Two Souls Review;9;Superb; Beyond: Two Souls is a fascinating experience that expertly links story and mechanics to further your connection to the world.;Tom vehemently defends David Cage's previous game Heavy Rain--plot holes and all--and wishes more developers would break free of industry conventions to create wholly unique experiences.
BioShock Infinite - A Fan Scorned Review;4;Poor; The beauty of BioShock Infinite is only skin deep as tedious combat and a tiresome story overshadow its artistic pleasures.;The original BioShock is one of Tom's favorite games ever. He will most likely love any game that tells a fascinating story and uses the mechanics to build on those themes.
Disney Infinity - A Parent's Take Review;8;Great; In our Other Take on Disney Infinity, we look at the game from a parent's point of view and see how suitable the game is for junior players.;Randolph Ramsay played Disney Infinity with his four-year-old son, but also played quite a bit on his own (about 20 hours in total). He's had minimal exposure with other toy-based games, but did play Skylanders for about two hours once with an 11-year-old as a tutor.
Card Hunter Review;8;Great; Card Hunter's fusion of tabletop role-playing games and trading cards is easy to get into and hard to pull away from.;Daniel Starkey's first review for GameSpot was for Starseed Pilgrim, and he's been part of the freelancing team ever since!
Shadow Warrior Review;7;Good; Shadow Warrior's fiery action reaches into the past, but its sense of progression is entirely modern.;Kevin VanOrd likes a good old-school shooter and a good dirty joke. After refreshing his memories with a bit of Wang-focused fun with the original Shadow Warrior, he was glad to see that the remake lived up to its legacy. If you consider genitalia humor to be a legacy, anyway.
NBA 2K14 Review;8;Great; By offering further refinements to already impressive controls and animations, NBA 2K14 is one step closer to bringing the real sport to the digital world.;Tom has been cheering on the Indiana Pacers for more than two decades, and has been playing basketball games for just as long. The days of Arch Rivals are thankfully long over.
Alien Rage Review;5;Mediocre; Alien Rage is a generic shooter notable only for its intense difficulty.;Daniel Shannon still remembers the day when his family got a 486 with a CD-ROM drive. He used that PC to play an immense amount of Tie Fighter, Civilization 2, and Doom. For the purposes of this review, Daniel beat Alien Rage‰Ûªs campaign on Hard, a task that took him around 17 hours.
Scribblenauts Unmasked Review;5;Mediocre; An extensive cast of DC characters can't help Scribblenauts Unmasked overcome the dangers posed by its own flawed internal logic.;Carolyn Petit had never played a Scribblenauts game before, but she has been saving universes with the power of her imagination ever since she saw The NeverEnding Story as a child.
Rain Review;7;Good; Rain uses chilling atmosphere and a heartfelt story to draw you in to this endearing adventure.;Nothing makes Tom feel like a brain champion quite like solving a tricky puzzle. And when such puzzles are complemented by a moving story and evocative aesthetics, that's even better.
Pokemon X/Y Review;8;Great; Pokemon X and Y benefit greatly from their leap to a fully 3D world, and have plenty to offer both veterans and novices alike.;Randolph Ramsay played Pokemon obsessively in his youth, and particularly loved the original 151 in Red/Blue. While he skipped the Black/White games, he still managed the watch the anime, so he‰Ûªs Team Snivy all the way. Randolph finished Pokemon Y in around 35 hours for the purposes of this review.
Pokemon X/Y Review;8;Great; Pokemon X and Y benefit greatly from their leap to a fully 3D world, and have plenty to offer both veterans and novices alike.;Randolph Ramsay played Pokemon obsessively in his youth, and particularly loved the original 151 in Red/Blue. While he skipped the Black/White games, he still managed the watch the anime, so he‰Ûªs Team Snivy all the way. Randolph finished Pokemon X/Y in around 35 hours for the purposes of this review.
Armored Core: Verdict Day Review;6;Fair; Brutal robot-destroying fun is buried deep, but this giant mech battling series could still use an oil change.;Nathan Meunier's love affair with giant robot warfare dates all the way back to the original MechWarrior on MS-DOS. It's been a while since he last dug into the Armored Core series, but he's not one turn down any opportunity to hop into a mech cockpit. For this review, Nathan spent approximately 22 hours pummeling big metal things across the solo campaign and multiplayer war.
MechWarrior Online Review;6;Fair; MechWarrior Online gets the feel of mech combat right, but its lack of variety taints the experience.;Leif Johnson likes big robots and massive online games.
FIFA 14 Review;8;Great; FIFA 14 is an exercise in subtle refinements and clever tweaks that transforms the familiar into something that feels fresh, exciting, and always engaging.;"Mark is based in the UK, where soccer is known as ""football"", and from where he's been reviewing FIFA and PES for the last three years."
Doorways Review;4;Poor; Doorways shoots for scares, but elicits yawns.;In the 90 minutes it took to complete the first two chapters of Doorways, Kevin VanOrd pined for all the great scary games that he could have been playing instead.
Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death Review;7;Good; It may not be novel, but Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death is still a boisterous and bombastic blast.;Kevin VanOrd likes big explosions and cheesy humor, which Marlow Briggs has an abundance of. He spent about four hours completing the game's campaign, and another hour fooling around on hard difficulty.
Takedown: Red Sabre Review;2;Terrible; Takedown: Red Sabre is an unfinished, broken mess of a tactical shooter that offers not even one redemptive bright spot.;Brett Todd has reviewed more bad games for GameSpot--and awesome ones too--than he cares to admit.
Etrian Odyssey Untold: The Millenium Girl Review;8;Great; The original Etrian Odyssey is remade with refined customization, enchanting visuals, and an intriguing story.;Having followed Etrian Odyssey since its inception, Miguel was curious how the series would come full circle with this remake. To play the story mode first and then to take that campaign's bonuses into a New Game+ playthrough of the classic mode resulted in 65 hours of play time. Miguel's been an amateur RPG cartographer ever since he used graph paper to map out his brother's exploits in the original Wizardry.
Dragon Fantasy Book II Review;3;Bad; Dragon Fantasy Book II is a pale shadow of the Super Nintendo role-playing games that it is inspired by.;Brian Albert was a beloved freelancer at GameSpot until he joined the illustrious staff at IGN! We miss you, Brian.
Final Fantasy XIV Online: A Realm Reborn Review;7;Good; It's no revolution, but Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn is a beautiful and charming online game with plenty to see and do.;Kevin VanOrd is a lifelong RPG lover and violin player. When he isn't busy building PCs and composing symphonies, he watches American Dad reruns with his fat cat, Ollie.
F1 2013 Review;8;Great; F1 2013 takes you on a nostalgia trip into the history of Formula One, while compelling new modes and subtle improvements layer atop a familiar, but winning formula.;Danny has been a GameSpot community member since 2005. Since joining the staff as a video journalist in 2011 he has lost touch with most of his friends and family. He looks forward to the day achievement points become legal tender so he can return to Ireland and fix its broken economy.
Steamworld Dig Review;7;Good; SteamWorld Dig is a charming, atmospheric exploration adventure, but it grinds to a halt just when it starts going full steam.;Heidi Kemps likes long role-playing games, intricate fighting games, and all things Japanese.
Foul Play Review;6;Fair; It's hardly foul, but good ideas and charming animations aren't enough to save Foul Play from repetition.;Britton Peele is a freelance writer for GameSpot and a Digital Entertainment Editor for The Dallas Morning News. Find him on Twitter @BrittonPeele.
Killzone: Mercenary Review;7;Good; Killzone: Mercenary is a standard but enjoyable shooter and one of the best-looking games on the Vita.;Before Killzone: Mercenary, the only Killzone game Carolyn had played was Killzone 2. Her writing services are not available to the highest bidder.
Grand Theft Auto V Review;9;Superb; Grand Theft Auto V is an outrageous, exhilarating, sometimes troubling crime epic that pushes open-world game design forward in amazing ways.;Carolyn has been a huge fan of the Grand Theft Auto games ever since she hit the streets of Liberty City in GTA III. She is definitely not currently wanted by police in 17 states.
PES 2014 Review;6;Fair; PES 2014 moves ever closer towards simulation, and in doing so forgets exactly what makes the series so different and so much fun in the first place.;"Mark is based in the UK, where soccer is known as ""football"", and from where he's been reviewing FIFA and PES for the last three years."
The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD Review;8;Great; The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker HD is a lovingly updated version of a timeless, though flawed, adventure.;Martin remembers the excitement of preordering the original GameCube version back in 2003. Art from the game has regularly featured up as his desktop wallpaper over the past decade.
Arma III Review;8;Great; ARMA III delivers sprawling geography, intense online military engagement, and a dedicated community. Just be prepared to give as much as you take.;Kevin VanOrd is a lifelong RPG lover and violin player. When he isn't busy building PCs and composing symphonies, he watches American Dad reruns with his fat cat, Ollie.
Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 ReMIX Review;7;Good; The Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 Remix compilation makes beautiful magic, but is still flawed in familiar places.;Jason Venter has finished hundreds of video games since discovering the hobby in the late '80s, and he hopes to play and write about hundreds more before they bury him.
NHL 14 Review;6;Fair; NHL 14 adds little of note to NHL 13 aside from better hitting, more fighting, and a disappointing NHL 94 retro mode.;Brett Todd has reviewed more bad games for GameSpot--and awesome ones too--than he cares to admit.
NHL 14 Review;6;Fair; NHL 14 adds little of note to NHL 13 aside from better hitting, more fighting, and a disappointing NHL 94 retro mode.;Brett Todd has reviewed more bad games for GameSpot--and awesome ones too--than he cares to admit.
Legend of Dungeon Review;6;Fair; Combining beat-'em-up action with randomized levels and loot, Legend of Dungeon offers just enough variety to stem the tide of repetitive gameplay.;Britton Peele is a freelance writer for GameSpot and a Digital Entertainment Editor for The Dallas Morning News. Find him on Twitter @BrittonPeele.
Outlast Review;7;Good; Outlast is a weapons-free survival horror adventure that elicits frequent bouts of dread.;Leif Johnson is a prolific freelancer from Chicago who confuses people by speaking with an East Texas accent. Somehow a childhood of herding cattle and raising emus prepared him for researching medieval texts for several years, but these days he fills his free time by smashing bad guys with big swords. In RPGs, of course.
Diablo III Review;8;Great; Diablo III's captivating cooperative loot-driven gameplay makes the transition to console intact.;Carolyn's been venturing into monster-infested dungeons in search of riches since the days of Gauntlet. She's always looking for gear that will let her spend less time sleeping and spend more time playing games.
Total War: Rome II Review;8;Great; Total War: Rome II turns the battlefields of Ancient Europe into an engrossing strategic theater.;Dan Starkey's first review for GameSpot was for Starseed Pilgrim, and he's been pleased to remain on hand ever since!
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows Review;3;Bad; Game-breaking glitches and a poor camera make TMNT: Out of the Shadows a bruised and battered shell of what it could have been.;Brian Albert was a beloved freelancer at GameSpot until he joined the illustrious staff at IGN! We miss you, Brian.
Shelter Review;7;Good; Shelter doesn't reach the high level of profundity it aims for, but this journey through the wilds makes a few poignant points all the same.;Kevin VanOrd has a cat named Ollie who refuses to play bass in Rock Band.
Puppeteer Review;9;Superb; Wildly imaginative and brimming with style, Puppeteer is a fantastic platformer that's heaps of fun for kids and adults alike.;Mark managed to get all 121 stars in Mario Galaxy and all 242 in Mario Galaxy 2, which he commemorates with framed laminated screenshots on his desk. Suffice to say, he's quite the platformer fan.
Hatsune Miku: Project Diva F Review;7;Good; Rhythm fans will find a lot of music, challenge, and customization to love as they get to know Hatsune Miku: Project Diva F.;Jason Venter has finished hundreds of video games since discovering the hobby in the late '80s, and he hopes to play and write about hundreds more before they bury him.
Castlevania: Lords of Shadow Ultimate Edition Review;7;Good; The Ultimate Edition of Castlevania: Lords of Shadow breathes new life into the three-year-old game through improved graphics and extra content.;Castlevania's been a favorite series of Peter's since the Nintendo Entertainment System, starting with Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse.
Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs Review;8;Great; Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is extremely disturbing, more than a little disgusting, and impossible to stop playing.;Brett Todd has reviewed more bad games for GameSpot--and awesome ones too--than he cares to admit.
KickBeat Review;7;Good; KickBeat is a plucky new contender in the rhythm gaming arena, with punishing difficulty and pumping industrial beats.;Brittany Vincent has been freelancing for GameSpot ever since her review for World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria.
Tales of Xillia Review;7;Good; Tales of Xillia is a gorgeous and fast-paced Japanese role-playing game that suffers from a few questionable design choices.;Heidi Kemps likes long role-playing games, intricate fighting games, and all things Japanese.
Spelunky Review;9;Superb; Major improvements to the cooperative mode coupled with the Vita's portability make this the best version of the already excellent Spelunky.;Tom has a two-hour commute to work each day. Don't feel sorry for him, though, because he happily rides the rails while trying desperately to finally reach Hell.
Diablo III Review;8;Great; Diablo III's captivating cooperative loot-driven gameplay makes the transition to console intact.;Carolyn's been venturing into monster-infested dungeons in search of riches since the days of Gauntlet. She's always looking for gear that will let her spend less time sleeping and spend more time playing games.
Space Hulk Review;6;Fair; Its tense missions retain the spirit of the board game, but Space Hulk is ultimately a disappointing take on the Games Workshop classic.;Brett Todd has reviewed more bad games for GameSpot--and awesome ones too--than he cares to admit.
Lost Planet 3 Review;5;Mediocre; Lost Planet 3 is both less exasperating and less diverse than its predecessors.;Kevin VanOrd has a cat named Ollie who refuses to play bass in Rock Band.
Lost Planet 3 Review;5;Mediocre; Lost Planet 3 is both less exasperating and less diverse than its predecessors.;Kevin VanOrd has a cat named Ollie who refuses to play bass in Rock Band.
Race the Sun Review;8;Great; Race the Sun is an elegant endeavor, pairing slick action and stiff challenge with systems that make you want to come back day after day.;"Even though he recognizes the term ""endless runner"" for the oxymoron it is, Chris Watters still enjoys trying to press onward and outdo his friends in petty leaderboard squabbles."
Lost Planet 3 Review;5;Mediocre; Lost Planet 3 is both less exasperating and less diverse than its predecessors.;Kevin VanOrd is a lifelong RPG lover and violin player. When he isn't busy building PCs and composing symphonies, he watches American Dad reruns with his fat cat, Ollie.
Rayman Legends Review;8;Great; The strange and delightful Rayman Legends offers a dizzying adventure whose only low point is in the few touch-screen stages.;Tom is an unabashed lover of platforms. He has lost hours in everything from the Mushroom Kingdom to the warped world of Super Meat Boy, only shying away from those dreadful Sonic games.
Disney Castle of Illusion HD Review;7;Good; Simple, satisfying gameplay and Disney-quality art make Castle of Illusion a remake worth exploring.;Brian Albert was a beloved freelancer at GameSpot until he joined the illustrious staff at IGN! We miss you, Brian.
Flashback Review;4;Poor; Flashback is a great-looking remake of a classic game, but playing it is an exercise in confusion and frustration.;Dan Starkey's first review for GameSpot was for Starseed Pilgrim, and he's been pleased to remain on hand ever since!
Killer Is Dead Review;5;Mediocre; Killer Is Dead is filled with Suda 51 eccentricity, but it struggles to stay relevant with inconsistent combat, a poorly told story, and some awkwardly sleazy moments.;Mark is a senior staff writer based out of the UK, the home of heavy metal and superior chocolate.
Divekick Review;7;Good; Divekick's single-player game is lacking, but this two-button brawler turns into feet-flying fun with friends.;
Madden NFL 25 Review;6;Fair; Madden NFL 25 marks a quarter-century of football gaming with a disappointing addition to this venerable franchise.;
Madden NFL 25 Review;6;Fair; Madden NFL 25 marks a quarter-century of football gaming with a disappointing addition to this venerable franchise.;
Payday 2 Review;7;Good; Payday 2 brings crime to life with an alluring intensity that entertains in spite of some rough edges.;Chris enjoys aiming down virtual sights, traipsing through fantastical lands, and striving to be grossly incandescent.
Rayman Legends Review;9;Superb; Rayman Legends melds abject strangeness with diverse platforming to create an adventure that's as enjoyable as it is challenging.;Tom marveled at the stunning sights while bopping his head to the music during the course of the dozen or so hours he spent in Rayman's shoes. Though not as challenging as he likes his platformers, Legends exuded so much joy that Tom was helpless to resist.
Disney Infinity Review;6;Fair; The greatness of Disney Infinity's Toybox is undermined by the carelessness of its structured content.;Kevin VanOrd is a lifelong RPG lover and violin player. When he isn't busy building PCs and composing symphonies, he watches American Dad reruns with his fat cat, Ollie.
Payday 2 Review;7;Good; Payday 2 brings crime to life with an alluring intensity that entertains in spite of some rough edges.;Chris Watters doesn't do much of his home gaming on PC as a matter of comfort, but for Payday 2, he makes an exception. A heist without headset chatter is a breeding ground for Waingros.
Payday 2 Review;7;Good; Payday 2 brings crime to life with an alluring intensity that entertains in spite of some rough edges.;Chris enjoys aiming down virtual sights, traipsing through fantastical lands, and striving to be grossly incandescent.
Europa Universalis IV Review;9;Superb; Complex and rewarding strategizing makes the fourth game in the Europa Universalis dynasty shine.;"Daniel Shannon still remembers the day when his family got a 486 with a CD-ROM drive. He used that PC to play an immense amount of Tie Fighter, Civilization 2, and Doom. Since he grew up without a console he insists that they are a ""fad"" and refers to them collectively as ""Nintendos."" Too this day he is skeptical about anything that doesn't use either a flightstick or a keyboard and mouse."
The Bureau: XCOM Declassified Review;6;Fair; It delivers some enjoyable stretches of shooting action, but The Bureau: XCOM Declassified too often transforms the series' signature tension into tedium.;Kevin VanOrd is a lifelong RPG lover and violin player. When he isn't busy building PCs and composing symphonies, he watches American Dad reruns with his fat cat, Ollie.
The Bureau: XCOM Declassified Review;6;Fair; It delivers some enjoyable stretches of shooting action, but The Bureau: XCOM Declassified too often transforms the series' signature tension into tedium.;Kevin VanOrd has a cat named Ollie who refuses to play bass in Rock Band.

Charlie Murder Review;7.5;Good; Beer and blood spray punctuate the fun punk rock brawler Charlie Murder.;

Open Me Review;5;Mediocre; Awkward controls and other flaws make it hard to appreciate the innovative and devious puzzles in Open Me.;
Beatbuddy: Tale of the Guardians Review;7.5;Good; Beatbuddy is an adept fusion of music and gameplay.;Leif Johnson is a prolific freelancer from Chicago who confuses people by speaking with an East Texas accent. Somehow a childhood of herding cattle and raising emus prepared him for researching medieval texts for several years, but these days he fills his free time by smashing bad guys with big swords. In RPGs, of course.
Gone Home Review;9.5;Superb; With excellent writing and remarkable attention to period detail, Gone Home turns the process of exploring a house into a captivating and deeply poignant journey of discovery.;Carolyn is old enough to remember the 1990s. In fact, it was in the 90s that she played Myst, a game that captivated her by creating a fascinating environment that had a story just waiting for her to discover.
Saints Row IV Review;7.5;Good; Saints Row IV's crazy missions, fun superpowers, and funny writing make it an enjoyable way to live out your destructive fantasies.;Carolyn has been wreaking havoc in urban open worlds since the release of Grand Theft Auto III. Alas, she hasn't yet figured out how to leap around San Francisco like some sort of real-life Neo.
Spelunky Review;8.5;Great; As Spelunky makes its way to the PC, the rewards and dangers are just as alluring as they were one year ago.;
Dishonored: The Brigmore Witches Review;8;Great; The Brigmore Witches is a haunting end to the Dishonored story arc.;Leif Johnson is a prolific freelancer from Chicago who confuses people by speaking with an East Texas accent. Somehow a childhood of herding cattle and raising emus prepared him for researching medieval texts for several years, but these days he fills his free time by smashing bad guys with big swords.

Mamorukun Curse Review;7;Good; Don't let the candy colors fool you;
Saints Row IV Review;7.5;Good; Saints Row IV's crazy missions, fun superpowers, and funny writing make it an enjoyable way to live out your destructive fantasies.;Carolyn has been wreaking havoc in urban open worlds since the release of Grand Theft Auto III. Alas, she hasn't yet figured out how to leap around San Francisco like some sort of real-life Neo.
Cubetractor Review;7.5;Good; In the cute and clever Cubetractor, simple mechanics give rise to fiendishly difficult situations.;Dan Starkey's first review for GameSpot was for Starseed Pilgrim, and he's been pleased to remain on hand ever since!

Godzilla: Unleashed Review;3.5;Bad; Unleashed is the worst thing to happen to Godzilla since getting killed by Mothra's babies.;

Contra 4 Review;8;Great; It's mean, it's intense, it's difficult, and it's a raucous good time. In a nutshell, it's Contra.;

Medal of Honor: Airborne Review;7;Good; The single-player campaign doesn't get cooking until the last two levels, but those two levels combined with solid multiplayer make it worth enlisting in the Airborne.;

Geometry Wars: Galaxies Review;7;Good; The control scheme has its quirks, but this is still an intense and enjoyable shooter.;

Beowulf: The Game Review;5;Mediocre; Even a merry band of adventurous thanes can't save this quest from ruin.;

Beowulf: The Game Review;5;Mediocre; Even a merry band of adventurous thanes can't save this quest from ruin.;

NBA Live 08 Review;7.5;Good; Thanks to significantly improved gameplay, NBA Live 08 is a good, solid basketball game.;
Tetris Splash Review;5.5;Mediocre; Save for its fish tank presentation, this is a wholly unremarkable version of Tetris.;

FIFA 08 Review;8.5;Great; The first FIFA for the PS3 is an impressive debut, and while it can be difficult at times, it's a polished and highly playable game.;

Worms: Open Warfare 2 Review;7;Good; Though the additions and adjustments to the standard Worms experience aren't game changing, the playful violence and light strategy still hold up.;
Kengo: Legend of the 9 Review;3;Bad; Who knew that samurai swordfighting could ever be so dull and annoying?;

MySims Review;6.5;Fair; Too much construction and not enough socializing keep MySims from really flourishing.;
High Stakes on the Vegas Strip: Poker Edition Review;7;Good; High Stakes is a competent, no-frills poker game that won't dazzle you with its presentation, but does offer up solid gameplay.;
Sonic Rush Adventure Review;8;Great; Sega and Sonic Team would like to remind you that Sonic the Hedgehog can still be a whole lot of high-speed fun.;

Super C Review;6.5;Fair; This sequel to Contra delivers the same run-and-gun action the series is known for.;
Fatal Inertia Review;6;Fair; Floaty physics and an underwhelming sense of speed add up to a decent, but not great, sci-fi racing game.;

DiRT Review;8.5;Great; As a graphical showpiece, DiRT is an unbridled success. It also happens to be an entirely enjoyable rally racer.;

Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2 Review;6.5;Fair; The Ghost Recon series makes a solid debut on the PlayStation Portable with this action-filled shooter, but competitive multiplayer is missing.;

Cyberball 2072 Review;2;Terrible; Without the ability to compete against human opponents, this version of Cyberball 2072 is a completely useless waste.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Carnival Games Review;4.5;Poor; Unless fumbling your way through half-baked minigames to win some virtual stuffed animals sounds like fun, you should leave this overpriced collection on the shelf.;

Anacapri - The Dream Review;2.5;Terrible; Anacapri has more in common with the ancient gameplay of early '90s adventures than anything modern, but even as a pseudo-nostalgia piece, it's no fun at all.;
Instinct Review;2;Terrible; Terrible AI and indecipherable dialogue are just two of the many problems afflicting this zombie shooter.;
Naruto: Uzumaki Chronicles 2 Review;5.5;Mediocre; The Naruto license does little to compensate for this forgettable brawler's undemanding combat and tedious story.;

World Sports Competition Review;6.5;Fair; If you can convince your friends to play alongside you, World Sports Competition can be quite fun.;

Operation: Vietnam Review;5.5;Mediocre; Majesco's portable shooter is a decent distraction, but not much more.;
Medal of Honor: Airborne Review;7;Good; The single-player campaign doesn't get cooking until the last two levels, but those two levels combined with solid multiplayer make it worth enlisting in Airborne.;

Wild ARMs 5 Review;7.5;Good; Though rough in places, the RPG series' latest entry is one of its weirdest, if not best.;
Tiger Woods PGA Tour 08 Review;7;Good; Tiger Woods 08 is good, but it's only slightly better than the last game.;
Dungeons & Dragons Tactics Review;5;Mediocre; An awkward interface and visual problems take the shine off of this well-intentioned D&D role-playing game.;

Dynamite Headdy Review;8;Great; Crazy head bashing, frequent boss battles, and the puppet show theme make Dynamite Headdy one heck of a 2D action romp.;
Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2 Review;8.5;Great; GRAW2 offers up a solid, though short, single-player campaign. But the bulk of its gameplay can be found in its impressive multiplayer offering.;
Stuntman Ignition Review;7.5;Good; If the heavy focus on trial and error doesn't rattle you, Stuntman: Ignition can be some explosive fun.;
Stuntman Ignition Review;7.5;Good; If the heavy focus on trial and error doesn't rattle you, Stuntman: Ignition can be some explosive fun.;

Destination: Treasure Island Review;7.5;Good; Sensible puzzles and an adventurous story make Destination: Treasure Island a treat for all ages.;
Rune Factory: A Fantasy Harvest Moon Review;7.5;Good; Despite a totally different visual style and the introduction of combat, Rune Factory still delivers a relatively straight-ahead Harvest Moon experience.;
Fatal Fury Battle Archives Volume 1 Review;6.5;Fair; Fatal Fury Special is the cornerstone of this collection. If that means anything to you, Fatal Fury Battle Archives Volume 1 might be worth a look.;

Death Jr. and the Science Fair of Doom Review;4.9;Poor; Imprecise controls, shoddy level design, and bland characters spell doom for Death Jr.'s latest adventure.;
Xevious Review;6.5;Fair; Xevious is a classic, so if you're a shooter fan that doesn't already have a version of this game, it's worth checking out.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.

.hack//G.U. vol. 2//Reminisce Review;5.7;Mediocre; As the second game in the G.U. trilogy, Reminisce is content to simply fill in the gap between the first and third game in the series.;
Mighty Bomb Jack Review;3.8;Bad; Mighty Bomb Jack is a repetitive, broken side-scroller that was somehow popular for a few months in 1987.;

MLB 07: The Show Review;8.2;Great; Though it doesn't take full advantage of the PlayStation 3 hardware, MLB 07: The Show is a great game, and the new road to the show mode is fantastic.;
Driver '76 Review;6;Fair; Driver '76 is a GTA clone that's technically uneven and short on originality, personality, and content.;
ArmA: Combat Operations Review;7;Good; ArmA is a challenging and immersive game of modern warfare, but one packed with plenty of frustrating moments and flaws, as well.;
Theatre of War Review;7.8;Good; Theatre of War makes World War II real-time strategy seem fresh, with outstanding attention to detail and realistic battlefields.;

Classic Action: Devilish Review;5;Mediocre; The only thing devilish about this overblown Breakout clone is its crummy collision detection.;

SNK vs. Capcom Card Fighters DS Review;4.9;Poor; SNK vs. Capcom Card Fighters DS is an often entertaining game, which makes its shoddy production and localization especially disappointing.;
The Red Star Review;8.1;Great; Despite spending years on the shelf, The Red Star ably delivers a unique and challenging blend of beat-'em-up and top-down shooter action.;
Spider-Man 3 Review;4.7;Poor; The PlayStation 2 version of Spider-Man 3 is a depressing combination of ugly to look at and dull to play.;
Spider-Man 3 Review;6.6;Fair; This is, at best, a step sideways for the Spider-Man movie games.;

Ancient Wars: Sparta Review;6.3;Fair; Don't expect any grand, over-the-top treatment of Spartan history, as Sparta: Ancient Wars is a very generic real-time strategy game.;
F.E.A.R. Review;7.1;Good; While F.E.A.R. is still a good action game, it doesn't live up to its potential, thanks to stuttering frame rates and washed-out graphics.;

Bionicle Heroes Review;4;Poor; The only thing the Wii version of Bionicle Heroes brings to the table is another reason not to play this game.;
Cube Review;5.2;Mediocre; Cube's decent premise is diluted by its dull visuals and uninspired puzzles.;
Legend of the Mystical Ninja Review;6.6;Fair; The goofy charm of Legend of the Mystical Ninja is hampered by its uneven gameplay.;

The Fast and the Furious Review;6;Fair; Aside from the name, this street racer has little to distinguish itself from an already crowded field.;

Calling All Cars! Review;6.7;Fair; Calling All Cars! is a frantic good time that's cut short by a serious lack of content.;
Beyond Oasis Review;7.5;Good; Beyond Oasis is a fast-paced alternative to The Legend of Zelda that places more emphasis on combat than on exploration.;

Aedis Eclipse: Generation of Chaos Review;6.1;Fair; The sequel to Generation of Chaos provides more of the same strategic gameplay without doing anything to correct the problems with the original.;Kevin VanOrd has a cat named Ollie who refuses to play bass in Rock Band.

Bust-a-Move Bash! Review;4.7;Poor; Controls that fluctuate between touchy and unresponsive, very few game modes, and lousy multiplayer all conspire to bring down Bust-A-Move Bash!;
Pinball FX Review;6.1;Fair; Pinball FX is a disappointing set of virtual pinball machines with sketchy ball physics.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Gyruss Review;6.3;Fair; Unless you're already a huge Gyruss fan, this isn't a must-own Xbox Live Arcade download.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Battle Lode Runner Review;5;Mediocre; Battle Lode Runner is good news for anyone hoping to see other Japan exclusives in the North American Virtual Console shop, but that's about it.;

Eets: Chowdown Review;7.9;Good; A unique sensibility keeps Eets: Chowdown from just being a Lemmings clone.;
Air Battles: Sky Defender Review;7.5;Good; Air Battles: Sky Defender makes for a solid introduction to the flight combat genre for newer players, and the price is right too.;
Bravoman Review;2.9;Terrible; The only good thing about Bravoman is that its poorly translated dialogue is sometimes amusing.;
Eureka Seven Vol. 2: The New Vision Review;6;Fair; By evening out the presentation and focusing the story, New Vision transforms the Eureka Seven series from painful to playable.;
Whirlwind Over Vietnam Review;3.6;Bad; The novelty of the Vietnam War setting is just about all that Whirlwind Over Vietnam has going for it.;
PokÌ©mon Diamond/PokÌ©mon Pearl Review;8.5;Great; Diamond and Pearl do what the PokÌ©mon franchise has always done best--deliver an accessible and highly addictive role-playing game experience.;
Valhalla Knights Review;5.6;Mediocre; A deep character-creation system and sharp graphics are wasted on this dull, repetitive dungeon crawler.;
Pimp My Ride Review;1.7;Abysmal; Pimp My Ride was shoddy enough as a console game, but the PSP version goes that extra mile and makes it completely unplayable.;
3D Ultra Minigolf Adventures Review;5.5;Mediocre; 3D Ultra Minigolf Adventures is an unremarkable game that fails to capture the fun of real miniature golf.;
Chew-Man-Fu Review;6.7;Fair; Chew Man Fu is a challenging maze puzzler that earns its keep with loads of levels, support for two players, and a built-in level editor.;
Pocket Pool Review;3.4;Bad; Not only does Pocket Pool miserably fail to deliver an enjoyable game of billiards, but its attempts at titillation are more depressing than anything else.;
Galaga Review;5.3;Mediocre; Galaga for the Virtual Console is a perfect emulation of an imperfect port--the clunky NES version doesn't do Namco's shooter the justice it deserves.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Alex Kidd in the Enchanted Castle Review;3.8;Bad; Alex Kidd in the Enchanted Castle is a crummy jump-and-punch action romp that was already obsolete when it was first published nearly 20 years ago.;
Punch-Out!! Featuring Mr. Dream Review;8;Great; Easily one of the best games of the NES era, Punch-Out!! remains fun two decades after its initial release.;
Raiden III Review;6.3;Fair; It's enjoyable in spurts, but Raiden III doesn't stand out from other modern shoot-'em-ups, and that it isn't priced at a flat-out budget rate is a bit disquieting.;

Disney's Meet the Robinsons Review;4.3;Poor; On the Game Boy Advance, Disney's Meet the Robinsons is a straightforward action game that's clearly aimed at younger players.;
Romance of the Three Kingdoms IV: Wall of Fire Review;5.6;Mediocre; Romance of the Three Kingdoms IV is a deep, involved strategy game, but its methodical pace and steep learning curve negate much of its appeal.;
Dawnspire: Prelude Review;6.1;Fair; Dawnspire is an action RPG in the vein of Diablo, spiced up with capture-the-flag action but lacking most of the addictive fun of that great hackfest.;
Cake Mania Review;4;Poor; Unless your idea of fun is to stress yourself out by performing menial tasks, you'll want to pass on Cake Mania.;
Disney's Meet the Robinsons Review;6.6;Fair; It doesn't bear much resemblance to the movie, and it's short. Nevertheless, the DS rendition of Meet the Robinsons is a fun run-and-gun-style shooter.;

Dungeon Explorer Review;5.4;Mediocre; Dungeon Explorer's rudimentary design and unforgiving difficulty make it a tedious and often  frustrating game.;
Etrom: The Astral Essence Review;2;Terrible; Etrom: The Astral Essence is an unplayable, buggy mess.;

Made Man Review;2.6;Terrible; After a few hours with Made Man, you'll be begging for someone to put two in the back of your head.;
Mind Quiz: Your Brain Coach Review;4.9;Poor; Mind Quiz is a shameless rip-off of Nintendo's Brain Age, only Ubisoft and Sega forgot to clone the variety and occasional fun of that game.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Prince of Persia Rival Swords Review;7.1;Good; Rival Swords is much the same game as Two Thrones, which means it's still good, but it's nearly a year and a half late to the show.;
Prince of Persia Rival Swords Review;8.1;Great; Aside from being a great portable translation of Two Thrones, Rival Swords packs several worthwhile additions that sweeten the deal.;
Making History: The Calm and the Storm Review;6.8;Fair; Making History is an interesting, though dry, turn-based World War II strategy game.;
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Review;2.7;Terrible; Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles for the Nintendo Entertainment System is sadistically difficult, unpolished, and generally just isn't fun.;
Star Fox 64 Virtual Console Review;8.3;Great; This classic air- and space-combat game has aged better than you'd think, and despite its relative simplicity, it's still a blast to play.;
Rocky Balboa Review;6.1;Fair; Rocky Balboa has plenty of heart, but it's counted out by a poor fighting system and frustrating controls.;
Super Ghouls 'N Ghosts Review;6.9;Fair; Super Ghouls 'N Ghosts looks fine and sounds better, but it's one of the hardest video games you'll ever play.;
ProStroke Golf - World Tour 2007 Review;5.6;Mediocre; ProStroke Golf - World Tour 2007 is a passable effort, but one that fails to bring anything new to the world of golf games.;
Sam & Max Episode 5: Reality 2.0 Review;8;Great; While you'd probably be lost if you came in this late to the series, the fifth episode of Sam & Max is sharp and funny, more so than the previous ...;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Metal Slug Anthology Review;8.1;Great; The breakneck action of SNK's playfully over-the-top arcade shooter series still shines on the PS2, and it makes for a value-packed compilation.;
SingStar Pop Review;7.2;Good; Sony has delivered a second functional karaoke platform, this time with a more stylistically cohesive list of songs.;
Pogo Island Review;6.2;Fair; Those already committed to the games from Pogo.com on offer here might appreciate this portable package, though it still feels a little lean.;
Brian Lara International Cricket 2007 Review;7.5;Good; International Cricket 2007 offers easy-to-pick-up controls for an accessible experience, though it's perhaps a bit too easy, and hurt by a lack of game modes.;Randolph is the editor in chief of GameSpot, and needs more time to play games.
Silverfall Review;6.5;Fair; It's not a bad game, but Silverfall's enormous potential and pretty graphics are overshadowed by its weak story, poor interface, and frustrating design elements.;Kevin VanOrd has a cat named Ollie who refuses to play bass in Rock Band.
Theme Park Review;6.9;Fair; It's not as complex as current-day management sims, but this portable remake of the 1994 classic is as addictive and time consuming as ever.;
Guitar Hero II Review;8.9;Great; A fantastic debut for the series on the Xbox 360, Guitar Hero II adds great new content and even tweaks a few small problems from the PS2 version.;
Enchanted Arms Review;6.8;Fair; Enchanted Arms is a capable and often enjoyable role-playing game, but it's also one that you'll likely forget as soon as you finish it.;
Gain Ground Review;4.7;Poor; Gain Ground is a haphazardly conceived strategy game that's challenging for all the wrong reasons.;
Bonanza Bros Review;6.1;Fair; While often passed over because its solo play is so boring, Bonanza Bros. becomes a fun game of cops and robbers when two people are involved.;
Championship Manager 2007 Review;7.1;Good; The popular football management simulation is back on Sony's ageing console in a game that should provide fans an accessible fix.;
UEFA Champions League 2006-2007 Review;7.3;Good; UEFA Champions League is a good game, but it doesn't have the 360 version's card-collecting hook, and it's not much different from FIFA 07.;
Excitebike Review;6.4;Fair; Excitebike has nostalgia going for it, but it's also a lot of fun to play.;
Virtua Tennis 3 Review;7.3;Good; Virtua Tennis 3 is a good game, but it plays a little too much like Virtua Tennis: World Tour.;
Lumines Plus Review;7;Good;" Lumines Plus is a good puzzle game, but there's so little new that you'll find yourself wondering why the word ""plus"" is in the title.";
Honeycomb Beat Review;6.9;Fair; With a simple concept and some stylish design, Honeycomb Beat is a nice game to look at that ultimately doesn't go anywhere.;

Test Drive Unlimited Review;7.8;Good; The PSP version of Test Drive Unlimited crams in just about every online feature found in the PS2 version, and it does so without mucking up the experience.;
Medal of Honor: Vanguard Review;5.5;Mediocre; Medal of Honor: Vanguard is yet another run-of-the-mill WWII-based first-person shooter.;
Rayman Raving Rabbids Review;5.9;Mediocre; There's a functional, if utterly unremarkable, platformer to be found in Raving Rabbids on the DS.;
Shining Force Exa Review;5.3;Mediocre; Shining Force Exa is fun for the first few hours, but it quickly wears out its welcome with dull combat and a frame rate that struggles to keep up with ...;

Test Drive Unlimited Review;7.5;Good; A few aspects of Test Drive Unlimited have been lost in translation from the Xbox 360, but the game is still an impressive piece of online-racing technology.;
Test Drive Unlimited Review;7.5;Good; It's not as unlimited as its subtitle suggests, and it has a pervasively aimless feel, but Test Drive Unlimited still creates a fun, leisurely world to drive in.;
New Adventure Island Review;6.6;Fair; New Adventure Island is a challenging platformer that often feels like a racing game.;
Major League Baseball 2K7 Review;2.5;Terrible; On the Nintendo DS, Major League Baseball 2K7 is a cruddy-looking, vague approximation of baseball that lacks basic features every sports game should have.;
Steel Horizon Review;3.6;Bad; Floating adrift in the middle of the Pacific would rival the entertainment value of this strategy-less strategy game.;
Legend of Kage Review;3;Bad; The repetitive combat and cheap deaths in The Legend of Kage make it not worth your Virtual Console dollars.;
Konami Classics Series: Arcade Hits Review;7;Good; You won't enjoy every single one of the 15 games included, but Konami Classics has just enough good stuff to make it worthwhile.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened Review;8.3;Great; An engaging story, logical puzzles, and nice visuals combine to make The Awakened a great adventure game.;
Lost in Blue 2 Review;6.2;Fair; Lost in Blue 2 features some fun minigames, but overall it's a remarkably tedious example of a formula not worth continuing.;Kevin VanOrd has a cat named Ollie who refuses to play bass in Rock Band.
The Elder Scrolls IV: Shivering Isles Review;8.6;Great; Shivering Isles adds more than enough new and interesting content to give you a great reason to dive back into the world of Oblivion.;
The Elder Scrolls IV: Shivering Isles Review;8.6;Great; Shivering Isles adds more than enough new and interesting content to give you a great reason to dive back into the world of Oblivion.;
Tetris Evolution Review;6.6;Fair; Tetris Evolution is a competently made--if slightly pricey--rendition of the classic Russian puzzler.;
Frontline: Fields of Thunder Review;5.3;Mediocre; A new Blitzkrieg game in everything but its title, Frontline: Fields of Thunder is yet another cookie-cutter WWII RTS.;
Blazing Angels: Squadrons of WWII Review;6.2;Fair; Blazing Angels is shot out of the sky by its shaky graphical performance and overly floaty control options.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
UEFA Champions League 2006-2007 Review;7.6;Good; UEFA Champions League's unique method of building teams by collecting player cards makes up for it being EA's fourth soccer game for the 360 in just over a year.;
Command & Conquer 3 Tiberium Wars Review;9;Superb; Tiberium Wars is Command & Conquer at its best, and an absolute blast for series fans and newcomers alike.;Kevin VanOrd has a cat named Ollie who refuses to play bass in Rock Band.
The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Review;9.5;Superb; The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is an amazing role-playing game that should not be missed.;
Cooking Mama: Cook Off Review;5.5;Mediocre; Though Cook Off is a lot like Cooking Mama on the DS, something significant has been lost in the translation to the Wii.;
Silent Hunter: Wolves of the Pacific Review;8.3;Great; Silent Hunter 4 is an excellent simulation of World War II submarine warfare in the Pacific.;
TMNT Review;3.1;Bad; The environments are no fun to get through, fights are infrequent, and the simplistic combat is unfulfilling.;
TMNT Review;8.1;Great; TMNT on the Game Boy Advance is a rousing beat-'em-up and a shining example of a movie-based game done right.;
TMNT Review;3.4;Bad; The environments are no fun to get through, fights are infrequent, and the simplistic combat is unfulfilling.;
Full Auto 2: Battlelines Review;4.1;Poor; While Full Auto 2 isn't completely broken, there's nothing about it that makes it worth playing, either.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Genesis Rising: The Universal Crusade Review;5;Mediocre; Icky space bugs make Genesis Rising interesting. Even ickier tech bugs and design problems make Genesis Rising annoying.;
Earth Defense Force 2017 Review;7.1;Good; As archaic and clumsy as it can be, Earth Defense Force 2017 succeeds because of what a ridiculous bit of dumb fun it is.;
Wing Island Review;4.7;Poor; As a way to get a Wii Remote into Aunt Ethel's hands, Wing Island might work, but this is a pretty dull ride for anyone with more discerning tastes.;
Bio-Hazard Battle Review;7.3;Good; Bio-Hazard Battle is a solid horizontal-scrolling shooter loaded with creepy-crawly enemies.;
Castlevania: Symphony of the Night Review;8.5;Great; Symphony of the Night was an amazing adventure back in 1997, and even after 10 years, it's still most definitely worth playing.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
After Burner: Black Falcon Review;7.2;Good; This straight-ahead arcade action game hits its mark with a good deal of enthusiasm.;
Virtua Tennis 3 Review;8.2;Great; Once again, Sega serves up a winner with Virtua Tennis 3.;
Puzzle Quest Review;8.5;Great; The parts may seem commonplace, but Puzzle Quest's blend of RPG and puzzle-game convention makes for something refreshingly unique and dangerously addictive.;
Virtua Tennis 3 Review;8.4;Great; Once again, Sega serves up a winner with Virtua Tennis 3.;
Custom Robo Arena Review;7.9;Good; Exciting action and great multiplayer make Custom Robo Arena a game well worth playing.;
Kororinpa: Marble Mania Review;5.8;Mediocre; Kororinpa: Marble Mania gets challenging too late and doesn't have enough levels to hold your interest for long.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Alien Shooter: Vengeance Review;7.5;Good; Retro shooters don't get any bloodier or more intense than this.;
The Godfather: The Don's Edition Review;7.6;Good; The Don's Edition works a smattering of new content into The Godfather with good results, but it's not quite worth another look if you've played previous versions.;
Armored Core 4 Review;7.7;Good; It looks nicer, it plays faster, and with its lower barrier to entry, Armored Core 4 should appeal to more than just the series' faithful gearheads.;
Armored Core 4 Review;7.7;Good; It looks nicer, it plays faster, and with its lower barrier to entry, Armored Core 4 should appeal to more than just the series' faithful gearheads.;
The Godfather: Blackhand Edition Review;7.6;Good; The Godfather: Blackhand Edition works in a smattering of new content and a brand-new control scheme with good results.;
S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl Review;8.5;Great; It's got some quirks, but S.T.A.L.K.E.R. delivers a dynamic and impressive first-person gameplay experience you won't soon forget.;
Puzzle Quest Review;8.1;Great; The parts may seem commonplace, but Puzzle Quest's blend of RPG and puzzle-game convention makes for something refreshingly unique and dangerously addictive.;
TMNT Review;6.6;Fair; TMNT has some legitimately neat platforming sequences, but it's more frustrating than a kid-oriented game ought to be, and the combat is completely brain-dead.;
TMNT Review;6.6;Fair; TMNT has some legitimately neat platforming sequences, but it's more frustrating than a kid-oriented game ought to be, and the combat is completely brain-dead.;
TMNT Review;6;Fair; TMNT has some legitimately neat platforming sequences, but it's more frustrating than a kid-oriented game ought to be, and the combat is completely brain-dead.;
TMNT Review;6.4;Fair; TMNT has some legitimately neat platforming sequences, but it's more frustrating than a kid-oriented game ought to be, and the combat is completely brain-dead.;
GTI Racer Review;5.1;Mediocre; An amusing, harmless automobile brand inspires an amusing, harmless racing game.;
Splatterhouse Review;4.7;Poor; Splatterhouse is a mildly gruesome beat-'em-up that you'll play for about 15 minutes before moving on to something else.;
TMNT Review;6.4;Fair; TMNT has some legitimately neat platforming sequences, but it's more frustrating than a kid-oriented game ought to be, and the combat is completely brain-dead.;
Sonic Spinball Review;6.1;Fair; Sonic Spinball isn't pure pinball, and it isn't as freewheeling as the games that inspired it, but it does have an interesting, Sonic-themed twist.;
Elevator Action Review;5.2;Mediocre; Shooting bad guys and striving for high scores can be fun, but descending the same building over and over again gets old quick.;
College Hoops 2K7 Review;8;Great; College Hoops 2K7 is a great pick for anyone still in the market for a college basketball game this late in the season.;
Call of Duty: Roads to Victory Review;6.2;Fair; Although it may look like a Call of Duty game, Call of Duty: Roads to Victory lacks many of the aspects that have made the console games so much fun.;
Tortuga - Two Treasures Review;4.8;Poor; A pirate game fitting for Davy Jones's Locker.;
Spectrobes Review;6;Fair; As a scavenger sim Spectrobes absolutely succeeds, but scouring every inch of planet after digital planet will quickly wear thin for most people.;
Knights of the Temple II Review;4.1;Poor; The respectable combat system isn't enough to gloss over hideous bugs, a dull plot, and rotten controls.;Kevin VanOrd has a cat named Ollie who refuses to play bass in Rock Band.
QuickSpot Review;6.3;Fair; QuickSpot has about as much lasting value as you'd expect from a game that is exclusively about spotting differences between two pictures, which is to say, not much.;
Tecmo Bowl Review;7.1;Good; Even without licensed NFL players, Tecmo Bowl is a fun arcade-style football game.;
Titan Quest: Immortal Throne Review;7.9;Good; Immortal Throne offers some really good high-level content for established Titan Quest fans, while retroactively adding meaningful improvements to the original game.;
Tiger Woods PGA Tour 07 Review;7.5;Good; Tiger Woods 07's excellent use of the Wii's motion-sensing abilities makes it a worthwhile purchase for anyone looking to hit the links on the Wii.;
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Review;7.1;Good; The four-player co-op is pretty much what makes this update of the classic arcade Turtles beat-'em-up worth downloading, though the $5 price doesn't hurt either.;
Inuyasha: Secret of the Divine Jewel Review;3.9;Bad; Inuyasha for the DS is a lousy Final Fantasy knockoff with mediocre graphics and a ridiculously high encounter rate.;
God of War II Review;9.2;Superb; God of War II is another violent and highly entertaining achievement for the action adventure genre, and it's a fitting closeout to the PlayStation 2 era.;
Sword of Vermilion Review;4.2;Poor; Sword of Vermilion doesn't offer enough nostalgic charm to excuse its crude, tedious design.;
Battlefield 2142: Northern Strike Review;7.7;Good; The first booster pack for Battlefield 2142 offers up three exciting new maps and a new gameplay mode, making it a must-have for fans of the multiplayer action game.;

The Sacred Rings Review;4.5;Poor; Extremely difficult puzzles and a vague plot sink this ambitious Myst clone.;
F24: Stealth Fighter Review;3.5;Bad; Weak graphics and dodgy controls hamstring an already mediocre air combat game.;
Top Spin 2 Review;7.5;Good; While the core content itself is still plenty good, this port of an Xbox 360 game is weighed down by stability and performance issues.;
Major League Baseball 2K7 Review;6.8;Fair; MLB 2K7 is a decent game, but it's painfully obvious how little effort the developer put into improving this year's game over last year's.;
Runaway: The Dream of the Turtle Review;5.8;Mediocre; There isn't anything dreamy about this so-so adventure aside from a few half-decent puzzles and great graphics.;
Major League Baseball 2K7 Review;6.7;Fair; MLB 2K7 is a decent game, but it's painfully obvious how little effort the developer put into improving this year's game over last year's.;
Major League Baseball 2K7 Review;7.3;Good; It's only an incremental improvement over last year's game, but MLB 2K7 is packed with content and solid gameplay.;
Monster Kingdom: Jewel Summoner Review;6.3;Fair; Collecting monsters can be fun in Jewel Summoner, but the rest of the game feels like an afterthought.;
Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories Review;7.2;Good; Like Liberty City Stories before it, Vice City Stories isn't nearly as appealing as a PS2 game, but it's still got worthwhile qualities.;
Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2 Review;8.7;Great; GRAW2 offers up a better, though shorter, single-player game than its predecessor. But the bulk of its gameplay can be found in its impressive multiplayer game.;
Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved Review;6.7;Fair; Geometry Wars is a classy arcade-style shooter, but this PC release is missing a ton of features that would make it last longer.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
F24: Stealth Fighter Review;3.7;Bad; Weak graphics and dodgy controls hamstring an already mediocre air combat game.;
NBA Street Homecourt Review;8;Great; Light on content but deep on gameplay, NBA Street Homecourt's PlayStation 3 debut is ultimately a great one.;
Worms Review;7.5;Good; It does right by the classic Worms gameplay, and it's probably the best-looking Worms game ever;
Def Jam: Icon Review;8.1;Great; Def Jam: Icon plays well enough, but it really shines thanks to its crazy story mode and healthy roster.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Def Jam: Icon Review;8.1;Great; Def Jam: Icon plays well enough, but it really shines thanks to its crazy story and healthy roster.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Marvel Trading Card Game Review;6.5;Fair; Marvel TCG isn't too bad as far as digital trading-card games go, but it's unlikely to convert anyone not already invested in TCGs.;
M.A.C.H. Modified Air Combat Heroes Review;7.2;Good; M.A.C.H. is a solid flight game that offers plenty of speed and high-flying antics, but it's grounded by a limited selection of stages and activities.;
MotorStorm Review;7.9;Good; Motorstorm's rampageous brand of racing is a great deal of fun--it's just a pity there aren't more ways to experience it.;
Meteos: Disney Magic Review;7.9;Good; The Disney theme won't be everyone's cup of tea, but the core Meteos experience is still a ton of scribbling fun.;Kevin VanOrd has a cat named Ollie who refuses to play bass in Rock Band.
Ristar Review;7.6;Good; Ristar is a fun action romp and a little-known gem that still holds up a decade after its initial release, thanks mainly to the character's unique ability.;
Samurai Warriors 2 Empires Review;6.3;Fair; Once again, the strategy elements of the empires mode do a lot to make up for the mundanity of the aging Warriors combat system, but it's not quite enough.;
Wario: Master of Disguise Review;6.1;Fair; Wario: Master of Disguise is a passable puzzler, but it lacks polish, and the touch-screen controls weren't necessary.;
Major League Baseball 2K7 Review;7.8;Good; A handful of quirks keep it from being great, but MLB 2K7 is an improvement over MLB 2K6 in nearly every way, and it's a very solid baseball game.;
Secrets of the Ark: A Broken Sword Game Review;7.7;Good; Secrets of the Ark is a little too in love with itself, but this is still a first-rate traditional adventure with a great story and mostly commonsense puzzles.;
MLB 07: The Show Review;8.5;Great; Not a lot has changed since last year, but the new road-to-the-show mode is a fantastic addition and MLB 07: The Show is a great game.;
Major League Baseball 2K7 Review;7.4;Good; A handful of quirks keep it from being great, but MLB 2K7 is still a very solid baseball game.;
MLB 07: The Show Review;8;Great; Not a lot has changed since last year, but the new road-to-the-show mode is a fantastic addition and MLB 07: The Show is a great game.;
Samurai Warriors 2: Empires Review;6;Fair; Once again, the strategy elements of the empires mode do a lot to make up for the mundanity of the aging Warriors combat system, but it's not quite enough.;
Trioncube Review;5.3;Mediocre; A cute story mode isn't enough to compensate for Trioncube's unoriginal and incredibly easy take on the Tetris formula.;
Tekken 5: Dark Resurrection Review;8.3;Great; You'd be hard pressed to find a better modern fighting game for such an affordable price.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Military Madness Review;7.8;Good; Military Madness is an intricate, engaging turn-based strategy game along the same lines as Advance Wars.;
Back to Stone Review;5.5;Mediocre; Back to Stone is a bland, sloppy dungeon crawl in which you'll spend the majority of time pushing stone blocks around.;
War Front: Turning Point Review;7.5;Good; War Front: Turning Point is a decidedly different take on the WWII real-time strategy game, complete with jetpack Nazis and freeze rays.;
Alien Hominid HD Review;8.5;Great; Alien Hominid HD is a charming and challenging arcade-style shooter that everyone should check out.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Formula One Championship Edition Review;7.2;Good; Dry presentation aside, Formula One Championship Edition is a good racer that is just accessible enough to newcomers while still being deep enough for longtime fans.;
The Sims 2 Seasons Review;7.3;Good; Seasons doesn't add a lot of groundbreaking stuff to The Sims 2. And you know what? That's actually OK.;
SSX Blur Review;7.4;Good; SSX Blur has its moments, both joyful and frustrating, but it winds up being a solid entry in the SSX series.;
300: March to Glory Review;6.8;Fair; It's a simplistic hack-and-slash that tends to get painfully repetitive, but 300: March to Glory has its moments.;
Sam & Max Episode 4: Abe Lincoln Must Die! Review;7.3;Good;" Finally, a video game has come along with the courage to eliminate one of the greatest threats against society today: ""Honest"" Abe Lincoln.";Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Izuna: The Legend of the Unemployed Ninja Review;6.7;Fair; Despite its simplistic nature and barbaric difficulty level, Izuna: The Legend of the Unemployed Ninja can be intensely satisfying.;
Donkey Kong Country Review;7.7;Good; Time hasn't diminished how artful or fun Donkey Kong Country is.;
Chulip Review;6;Fair; There's something to be said for Chulip's abject weirdness and purposefully awkward structure, but they don't translate into a rewarding game experience.;
Dance Dance Revolution Universe Review;7.3;Good; DDR Universe offers the standard sorts of changes and upgrades you'd expect from this nearly decade-old series.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Galactic Civilizations II: Dark Avatar Review;9.1;Superb; The new features in Dark Avatar elevate the already superb Galactic Civilizations II to the title of undisputed best turn-based space strategy game on the PC.;
Arena Football: Road to Glory Review;6.2;Fair; Arena Football's Road to Glory has been paved with little more than a roster update and a few unappealing upgrades.;
Bullet Witch Review;5.5;Mediocre; The few moments when Bullet Witch shines are impressive, but not nearly enough to elevate the rest of the game above the dismal plane of mediocrity.;
Chili Con Carnage Review;7.4;Good; Chili Con Carnage is light on depth and fairly brief, but it's a raucous good time all the same.;
War Rock Review;5.5;Mediocre; War Rock is a mediocre online first-person shooter that feels more like an economic experiment than an actual retail product.;Kevin VanOrd has a cat named Ollie who refuses to play bass in Rock Band.
Q*bert Review;5.3;Mediocre; The updated graphics and tilt control support aren't enough to make Q*bert appeal to anyone other than extreme fans, and even those people will be disappointed.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Sonic and the Secret Rings Review;7.6;Good; Sonic and the Secret Rings delivers an excellent sense of speed and plenty of depth, and what's just as impressive is that it makes Sonic fun again.;
Winning Eleven: Pro Evolution Soccer 2007 Review;6.9;Fair; Konami's first attempt at bringing the seminal series to the DS may not appeal to serious soccer fans, but it has some neat features and can be fun in short ...;
Winning Eleven: Pro Evolution Soccer 2007 Review Review;8.2;Great; Konami's annual soccer series improves on its first PSP outing by refining its gameplay and introducing the master league mode.;
Gurumin: A Monstrous Adventure Review;8;Great; Gurumin's engaging combat mechanics, likable characters, and standout music easily make up for its more glaringly unoriginal qualities.;
Jade Empire: Special Edition Review;7.8;Good; The PC version of Jade Empire retains the great story and setting of the Xbox original, but the streamlined combat and core design haven't aged as gracefully.;Kevin VanOrd has a cat named Ollie who refuses to play bass in Rock Band.
flOw Review;7;Good; There's not an awful lot of game here, but flOw still makes for an attractive and soothing showpiece.;.
Xevious Review;3.9;Bad; Xevious broke new ground back in the day, but it hasn't withstood the test of time.;
Romance of the Three Kingdoms XI Review;6.9;Fair; The strategy is complex and rewarding, but the menu shuffling and extremely slow pace won't earn the series any new fans.;
Supreme Commander Review;8.7;Great; Supreme Commander delivers a deep and impressive strategy-gaming experience.;
Virtua Fighter 5 Review;8.1;Great; Virtua Fighter 5 builds upon VF4 with new moves and characters, making for a great sequel.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Streets of Rage Review;6.7;Fair; The soundtrack still pops, though it's hard to stay excited about the simple beat-'em-up action in Streets of Rage for very long.;
Ghost Rider Review;7.8;Good; Ghost Rider for the GBA is a visually intense, fun beat-'em-up that totally gets what the character is all about.;
SnoCross 2: Featuring Blair Morgan Review;3.8;Bad; The discount price isn't enough to make SnoCross 2: Featuring Blair Morgan an attractive purchase for even the most price-conscious consumer.;
Metal Slug Anthology Review;8.2;Great; The breakneck action of SNK's playfully over-the-top military shooter series makes for a great fit on the PSP, despite some additional load times.;
Ratchet & Clank: Size Matters Review;8.2;Great; Ratchet & Clank's signature gameplay travels to the PSP almost completely intact in Size Matters, which packs in a good-size single-player adventure.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Kid Icarus Review;5.1;Mediocre; Thanks to the Virtual Console, a new generation can experience the simple gameplay and cruel levels contained in Kid Icarus.;
Ice Climber Review;6.3;Fair; Whether you're playing alone or with a friend, Ice Climber is still challenging and fun.;
Kirby's Adventure Review;7.3;Good; Kirby's Adventure is a charming platformer that holds up because it isn't just another Super Mario clone.;
Maelstrom Review;4.2;Poor; Maelstrom can't even get the basics right, and the few features that sound interesting on paper end up being completely useless.;Kevin VanOrd has a cat named Ollie who refuses to play bass in Rock Band.
NBA Street Homecourt Review;8;Great; Deep on gameplay but light on content, NBA Street Homecourt's Xbox 360 debut is ultimately a great one.;
Vanguard: Saga of Heroes Review;7.5;Good; Experienced role players will enjoy the engaging combat and diplomatic gameplay, in spite of Vanguard's litany of bugs and singular focus on group adventuring.;Kevin VanOrd has a cat named Ollie who refuses to play bass in Rock Band.
Juka and the Monophonic Menace Review;6.3;Fair; Juka's quest is aesthetically pleasing and has some twists on the usual action RPG blueprint, but the easygoing gameplay is clearly geared toward younger players.;
Blitzkrieg 2: Fall of the Reich Review;4.4;Poor; Brutal difficulty is the only thing that sets this WWII real-time strategy game apart from its predecessors.;
Lunar Knights Review;8.4;Great; With a lengthy, engaging story, great production values, and loads of interesting gameplay touches, this is an action adventure game that's worth the challenge.;
Wii Play Review;5.4;Mediocre; Few of the nine minigames that make up Wii Play have much staying power.;
Ghost Rider Review;4;Poor; Ghost Rider steals liberally from several major action games, yet somehow avoids stealing the parts that made those games fun.;
Close Quarters Conflict Review;4.1;Poor; You've already got at least a couple of shooters on your hard drive far better than this one.;
Ghost Rider Review;4.3;Poor; Ghost Rider steals liberally from several major action games, yet somehow avoids stealing the parts that made those games fun.;
Paperboy Review;6.8;Fair; If you ever cared about the arcade version of Paperboy, you'll get some nostalgic excitement from this emulation of the original.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Fossil League: Dino Tournament Championship Review;7;Good; Despite the game's lackluster visuals, budding paleontologists and PokÌ©mon fans alike should find an enjoyable romp through time in this DS adventure.;
Crackdown Review;7.8;Good; Crackdown creates an exciting open world and gives you a lot of cool abilities, but there isn't enough main-game content to truly take advantage of these elements.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
DIRT - Origin of the Species Review;2;Terrible; When Origin of the Species isn't breaking your mind with its insane storyline and terrible gameplay, it's probably breaking itself with one of its many, many bugs.;
The Warriors Review;8.1;Great; A few translation imperfections aside, this is the same great beat-'em-up from 2005. If you never had a chance to play it on consoles, it's still well worth it.;
Patriots: A Nation Under Fire Review;2.9;Terrible; Even the promise of blowing away the most generic of terrorists in Middle America isn't enough to make Patriots anything more than a rote, mind-numbing shooter.;
MVP 07 NCAA Baseball Review;7.7;Good; The new pitching mechanic breathes some new life into the aging but still very good MVP Baseball franchise.;
Pro Evolution Soccer 6 Review;8.7;Great; Konami's sixth Pro Evolution Soccer title plays a superb game of football but offers little in the way of new features.;
Final Fantasy VI Advance Review;8.9;Great; Final Fantasy VI Advance is a great port of an excellent role-playing game, and it's one that shouldn't be missed.;
Root Beer Tapper Review;7.3;Good; This is a great, cheap way to get your hands on an underappreciated arcade classic.;
Starshatter: The Gathering Storm Review;6.7;Fair; This is an enhanced version of 2004's Starshatter that adds improved AI and production values, but that's about it.;
Vigilante Review;2.4;Terrible; It's surprising that Hudson has gone to the trouble of making such a terrible beat-'em-up available for the Wii's Virtual Console.;Frank Provo is a former freelance reviewer for GameSpot.
Soldier Blade Review;7.2;Good; Soldier Blade is a solid shoot-'em-up that keeps you busy with a steady outpouring of large enemy ships and accompanying gunfire.;
Pro Evolution Soccer 6 Review;8.1;Great; Konami's seminal football game finally makes its way to the Xbox 360, but it doesn't fulfil many next-generation ambitions.;
Ar Tonelico: Melody of Elemia Review;6.3;Fair; Ar tonelico is built on a solid role-playing foundation, but the lengthy character exchanges and lack of any challenge take a lot of the fun out of the game.;
Diddy Kong Racing DS Review;6.7;Fair; Diddy Kong Racing DS is an OK racer with plenty to do, but the ridiculous number of tasks you have to do to enjoy all of it may irritate those ...;
Fullmetal Alchemist: Dual Sympathy Review;4;Poor; A lousy conversion of the anime's story, as well as some equally poor beat-'em-up action, keeps the golden shine out of Fullmetal Alchemist on the DS.;
Super Mario World Review;8.5;Great; Unless you already own this game on one platform or another, or just hate fun, there's no reason not to download Super Mario World.;
Capcom Puzzle World Review;7.7;Good; Though not as expansive a collection as the title might suggest, Capcom Puzzle World is worth the price of admission for Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo alone.;
Ecco the Dolphin Review;5.6;Mediocre; All of the flaws that make Ecco so frustrating were easier to tolerate back when the concept was new and the graphics were leading edge. No such luck in 2007.;
Sonic the Hedgehog Review;4.2;Poor; Sonic the Hedgehog may share its name with the Genesis original, but this game is even more broken than most of the other recent Sonic games have been.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade Review;9.2;Superb; The Burning Crusade is a superb example of exactly what an expansion pack for any game should be.;
Battlestations: Midway Review;7.8;Good; Battlestations: Midway strikes just the right balance between action and strategy to create a game that's as unique as it is enjoyable.;
The Shield Review;3.9;Bad; Neither quality fan service nor a good action game on its own merits, The Shield fails miserably to live up to its license's pedigree.;
Underground Pool Review;3.1;Bad; Underground Pool is a squalid representation of the game of billiards.;
Contra III: The Alien Wars Review;7.2;Good; Contra III: The Alien Wars is every bit the vexing challenge it was back in the '90s, and it's still quite a bit of fun too.;
Bionicle Heroes Review;7.7;Good; Bionicle Heroes for the GBA is a slick run-and-gun shoot-'em-up.;
Bubble Bobble Evolution Review;4.6;Poor; Fans of Bubble Bobble, puzzle games, dinosaurs, or fun will be sorely disappointed.;
Bionicle Heroes Review;7.7;Good; Although it lacks online play, Bionicle Heroes is a surprisingly adept and enjoyable first-person shooter.;
Fuzion Frenzy 2 Review;7;Good; Its minigame format is a well-worn one, but the inclusion of online play in Fuzion Frenzy 2 gives the game an edge.;
Comix Zone Review;6.6;Fair; Comix Zone is a mediocre beat-'em-up that's supported by a unique gimmick.;
The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Review;8.5;Great; A Link to the Past is still great, and it hasn't been rereleased to death like some of Nintendo's other games, making it a great choice for Virtual Console fans.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
DMZ: North Korea Review;2.3;Terrible; A date with Kim Jong II would be more enjoyable than this shooter.;
Arthur and the Invisibles Review;3.2;Bad; It's a shame that Arthur and the Invisibles on the GBA can't just take after its namesake and disappear.;
Battlestations: Midway Review;7.9;Good; Battlestations: Midway strikes just the right balance between action and strategy to create a game that's as unique as it is enjoyable.;
Europa Universalis III Review;8.7;Great; It's as deep and broad as you would expect from a great strategy game, but Europa Universalis III's most notable achievement is how easy it is to get into.;Kevin VanOrd has a cat named Ollie who refuses to play bass in Rock Band.
Deal or No Deal Review;4.1;Poor; Take this deal and you'll be out $20 and minutes of your life you'll never get back.;
Sam & Max Episode 3: The Mole the Mob and the Meatball Review;7.1;Good; Sam & Max's third episode feels shorter than the previous two, and at least part of that is due to so many of the environments being recycled from previous episodes.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Arthur and the Invisibles Review;7;Good; The rapid-fire minigames found in Arthur and the Invisibles offer a different take on the WarioWare style of play, and they're fun for the short time the game lasts.;
Mini RC Rally Review;1.9;Abysmal; If you have the misfortune of playing Mini RC Rally, you can at least find solace in knowing the next game you play won't be any worse.;
Digimon World DS Review;7.2;Good; Digimon World DS is a solid, if unremarkable monster battle game, which pretty much means it's the best Digimon game ever made.;
Sid Meier's Pirates! Review;8.6;Great; The captivating PSP version of this classic PC strategy game captures all the charming fun of being a pirate of the Caribbean.;
Crashday Review;4.8;Poor; As the title advertises, Crashday has a fair number of car crashes, but the trouble is that it doesn't have much of anything else.;
Rafa Nadal Tennis Review;4.3;Poor; Rafa Nadal Tennis isn't a good game, but it's not the worst tennis game available for the Nintendo DS.;
Rogue Galaxy Review;8;Great; Like an anime version of Star Wars, this big, lavishly produced action RPG is another good reason not to shelve your PlayStation 2 just yet.;
Hotel Dusk: Room 215 Review;8.2;Great; Hotel Dusk weaves an absorbing noir-style mystery with traditional adventure game elements and stylish presentation and does it all with a deft touch.;
The Legend of Heroes III: Song of the Ocean Review;5.8;Mediocre; Legend of Heroes III is a competent and lengthy role-playing game, but it's painfully generic without the slightest tinge of originality or creative flair.;
Xiaolin Showdown Review;6.4;Fair; Xiaolin Showdown has its problems, but it's generally a solid beat-'em-up.;
Micro Machines V4 Review;5.3;Mediocre; The sheer number of cars and tracks in Micro Machines V4 doesn't make up for the underlying frustration of the racing.;
NCAA March Madness 07 Review;6.4;Fair; This is a lot like last year's game, except now instead of 06, it says 07 on the box.;
NCAA March Madness 07 Review;6.7;Fair; Beneath numerous flaws there's a decent basketball game in March Madness 07, but you've got to dig too deep to find it.;
R-Type Review;7.3;Good; While the original R-Type offers more precise action, R-Type III has bigger boss fights, better graphics, and a more forgiving learning curve.;
ToeJam & Earl Review;7.2;Good; Whether you remember ToeJam & Earl or not, this is a good, solid two-player game that's worth checking out.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Eragon Review;6.9;Fair; Eragon doesn't do much to embellish its simplistic design, but it's a surprisingly satisfying role-playing game despite its shortcomings.;
Arthur and the Invisibles Review;7;Good; Because of its high production values, fans of the movie may enjoy this movie tie-in, but the epic scope of the adventure is hampered by the unoriginal gameplay.;
R-Type III Review;7.6;Good; While the original R-Type offers more precise action, R-Type III has bigger boss fights, better graphics, and a more forgiving learning curve.;
Moto Roader Review;6.2;Fair; Moto Roader is fun when played with friends, but as a single-player experience it's a drag.;
Drive to Survive Review;2.3;Terrible; Drive to Survive will make you want to do neither.;
Gradius Review;7.2;Good; Gradius represented a significant step in the evolution of the shooter, and though its boss battles can be frustrating, much of the experience still stands up.;
Lemmings Review;7.2;Good; The cute creatures with suicidal tendencies are as appealing as ever, but without the features of the PSP version, Lemmings for the PS3 loses some of its appeal.;Kevin VanOrd has a cat named Ollie who refuses to play bass in Rock Band.
The Shield Review;3.9;Bad; Neither quality fan service nor a good action game on its own merits, The Shield fails miserably to live up to its license's pedigree.;
Heavy Weapon: Atomic Tank Review;7.9;Good; Heavy Weapon's arcade-style shooting is incredibly appealing, especially when you get into the ridiculous action in the multiplayer modes.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Street Fighter II: The World Warrior Review;7.2;Good; It isn't the best version of Street Fighter II, but World Warrior is still easily the best fighting game available so far on the Wii--Virtual Console or otherwise.;
Rayman Raving Rabbids Review;7.3;Good; The PC version of Raving Rabbids is still a goofy collection of minigames, but some of the fun was lost in translation from the Wii.;
March of the Penguins Review;4;Poor; Ironically, while this penguin-themed puzzle game seems geared toward younger players, it may be too challenging for the average kid.;
Avatar: The Last Airbender Review;5.7;Mediocre; The Avatar's DS debut serves up an engaging story and some slick 3D visuals, but it's otherwise just another mediocre brawler.;
Avatar: The Last Airbender Review;7;Good; Although it doesn't break any new ground, the Avatar's foray on the GBA is a lively action adventure that offers a solid mix of combat and puzzles.;
Avatar: The Last Airbender Review;6.9;Fair; Avatar on the PSP is a solid hack-and-slash that will likely appeal to fans of the show as well as anyone that has enjoyed similar games in the past.;
Xiaolin Showdown Review;3.6;Bad; This simplistic brawler's condescending attitude and one-note gameplay make it worth dodging.;
March of the Penguins Review;4;Poor; Ironically, while this penguin-themed puzzle game seems geared toward younger players, it may be too challenging for the average kid.;
Ms. Pac-Man Review;6.3;Fair; Are you dying to play some more Ms. Pac-Man? If so, then pick this up, but keep in mind that it's a very barebones emulation of the original game.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Rayman Raving Rabbids Review;5.3;Mediocre; Rayman Raving Rabbids on the GBA returns the titular hero to his platforming roots, but the game is so rote and uninteresting that it's hard to care all that much.;
Xiaolin Showdown Review;3.6;Bad; This simplistic brawler's condescending attitude and one-note gameplay make it worth dodging.;
Lost Planet: Extreme Condition Review;8.1;Great; Lost Planet: Extreme Condition makes shooting giant bugs every bit as fun as it should be, and even though it ends too quickly, you'll have a blast while it lasts.;
WarioWare: Smooth Moves Review;9.1;Superb; The Wii and WarioWare are a perfect match.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Justice for All Review;7.7;Good; Justice for All is a good, lengthy adventure with great character-driven storylines, but it fails to build upon the promising groundwork laid by the first game.;
Sam & Max Episode 2: Situation: Comedy Review;7.4;Good; Situation: Comedy stands on its own, but it isn't quite as good as the previous episode of the Sam & Max series.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Naruto: Uzumaki Chronicles Review;6.2;Fair; It's a decent brawler, but repetitive combat and missions keep it from rising above the level of Naruto fan service.;
Urban Champion Review;3.6;Bad; Urban Champion was barely passable 20 years ago, so you can probably guess that it hasn't aged especially well.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine Review;6.3;Fair; Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine is a fun little puzzle game that's just not quite worth the price of admission.;
Mazes of Fate Review;6.6;Fair; Mazes of Fate has a great premise and some interesting ideas, but it never leaves the trappings of the old-school dungeon crawlers it's based on.;Kevin VanOrd has a cat named Ollie who refuses to play bass in Rock Band.
GripShift Review;6.5;Fair; If you didn't like GripShift on the PSP this version won't change your mind, but it might be worth a look for anyone who hasn't played this driving/platform game.;
Karaoke Revolution Presents: American Idol Review;7.3;Good; The half-baked American Idol trappings don't detract from this otherwise solid iteration of Konami's long-lived karaoke series.;
Summon Night: Swordcraft Story 2 Review;7.3;Good; Swordcraft Story 2 sticks to the basics to deliver an easily enjoyable role-playing game that doesn't take itself too seriously.;
Metal Slug Anthology Review;7.5;Good; The breakneck action of SNK's playfully over-the-top military shooter series still holds up, despite compromised motion controls and additional load times.;
Super Castlevania IV Review;7.8;Good; One of the best early Castlevania games is available on the Virtual Console, and it still packs a decent bite.;
Worldwide Soccer Manager 2007 Review;8.1;Great; Sports Interactive slims down its PC hit so you can scratch the football management itch wherever you are.;
New Rally-X Review;4.7;Poor; New Rally-X wasn't a terribly exciting game when it was released in 1981, so it's tough to get worked up about an arcade-perfect version of it 25 years later.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Worldwide Soccer Manager 2007 Review;8.3;Great; Sports Interactive's best title to date combines stability and variety in an immersive football experience.;
Desperate Housewives: The Game Review;6.5;Fair; Desperate Housewives isn't much of a game, but it does a pretty good job of telling an original, interactive soap opera story in the quirky tone of the hit show.;
Wario's Woods Review;7;Good; If you missed it the first time around, now is your chance to check out one of the best puzzle games for the Nintendo Entertainment System.;
BattleZone Review;6.5;Fair; BattleZone is fun for the couple of hours it takes to finish, but it's over too quickly.;
FIFA Manager 07 Review;7.3;Good; FIFA Manager 07 is a beautifully presented and accessible football management game that's tailored for novices of the genre.;
Online Chess Kingdoms Review;6.4;Fair; Online Chess Kingdoms is predictably unsuccessful in its attempts to enhance the timeless classic, but thankfully it does let you play classic chess online or off.;
RACE - The WTCC Game Review;8.8;Great; Simbin follows up its GTR 2 success with another great PC racing sim, this time set in the World Touring Car series.;
Novadrome Review;5.6;Mediocre; Novadrome offers a glossy-looking take on the tried-and-true concept of futuristic car combat, but fails to do anything interesting or noteworthy with it.;
Baseball Review;4.2;Poor; Like so many of the early NES sports games, Baseball hasn't withstood the test of time.;
Super Mario Bros. Review;8.3;Great; Super Mario Bros. is still totally sweet, even after more than 20 years.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Alien Crush Review;7.5;Good; The Virtual Console breathes new life into this obscure, but very good, pinball game.;
Spider-Man: Battle for New York Review;4;Poor; Cruddy hit detection and poor hazard placement ruin this otherwise decent action romp.;
Spider-Man: Battle for New York Review;7;Good; Variety and slick presentation go a long way toward making you forget about the lack of originality and the quest's brief length.;
Star Wars: Lethal Alliance Review;7.2;Good; It takes a while to shift into high gear, but once it does, Star Wars: Lethal Alliance offers an enjoyable mix of shooting, puzzle-solving, and platforming.;Kevin VanOrd has a cat named Ollie who refuses to play bass in Rock Band.
Far Cry Vengeance Review;5.5;Mediocre; Far Cry Vengeance tries to blend recycled content with new gameplay designed for the Wii, but the results are lackluster across the board.;
Brothers in Arms D-Day Review;5.9;Mediocre; Brothers in Arms D-Day is based on a couple of great tactical shooters, but it suffers crippling losses in translation from consoles to the PSP.;
Blitz: Overtime Review;6.1;Fair; Overtime is an apt subtitle for this port of Blitz: The League, as the exceedingly lengthy load times and sluggish running speed run the game well past regulation.;
Blazing Angels: Squadrons of WWII Review;6.6;Fair; Blazing Angels' very straightforward campaign and barren online play don't add up to make a particularly engaging air combat game.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Bomberman Land Touch! Review;8.1;Great; The highlight of Bomberman Land Touch! is the excellent battle mode that supports as many as four players online and as many as eight offline.;
Delta Force: Black Hawk Down: Team Sabre Review;4.5;Poor; The PS2 version of this military shooter addresses some of the issues that hampered its 2-year-old PC counterpart, but it introduces far more problems than it fixes.;
Victoria: Revolutions Review;5.3;Mediocre; Revolutions does a nice job of fixing up Victoria, but it's more of a giant patch than an expansion.;
Donkey Kong Jr. Review;4.9;Poor; This is a perfect port of the NES version of Donkey Kong Jr.--all four levels of it.;
Gunstar Heroes Review;8.1;Great; Gunstar Heroes became a definitive run-and-gun action game when it was first released in 1993, and its quirky personality and nonstop intensity still shine through.;
Super Star Soldier Review;6.2;Fair; Super Star Soldier is a relic of the days when gruelingly difficult deep-space shoot-'em-ups were as common as today's first-person shooters.;
Star Trek: Legacy Review;7.2;Good; Star Trek Legacy for the Xbox 360 captures the grandeur and feel of the epic starship battles in the famous television series.;
Space Harrier II Review;6;Fair; A simple shoot-'em-up that looked flashy for its time, Space Harrier II is a reminder of how sequels aren't always as good as their predecessors.;
Tennis Review;5;Mediocre; Tennis can be entertaining for a little while, but it's difficult to recommend when there's a much better option available in Wii Sports' tennis game.;
Silent Heroes Review;5.2;Mediocre; Brutal difficulty makes Silent Heroes suitable solely for the squad-based real-time strategy experts.;
Luxor: The Wrath of Set Review;5.9;Mediocre; Luxor: The Wrath of Set's uninteresting gameplay and lackluster presentation don't do anything to set it apart from other, better puzzle games available for the PSP.;
Pimp My Ride Review;4.5;Poor; No amount of Xzibit influence or ride pimpage can save Pimp My Ride from its god-awful minigames and lousy driving mechanics.;
World Series of Poker: Tournament of Champions Review;5.2;Mediocre; As the first poker game for the Wii, World Series of Poker is serviceable, though the lack of online play and lackluster presentation don't help its cause.;
Cartoon Network Racing Review;6.3;Fair; The younger crowd may find Cartoon Network Racing to be an enjoyable racer featuring familiar and likable characters, but anyone else likely won't be as enamored.;
Cartoon Network Racing Review;3.8;Bad; This derivative kart racer is no fun for the entire family.;
Pimp My Ride Review;4.5;Poor; No amount of Xzibit influence or ride pimpage can save Pimp My Ride from its god-awful minigames and lousy driving mechanics.;
The Ant Bully Review;3.7;Bad; The Ant Bully on the Wii is basically the same uninteresting mess that came out for the GameCube six months earlier.;
Happy Feet Review;3.7;Bad; Even kids who loved the animated film won't find Happy Feet to be worth their time.;Kevin VanOrd has a cat named Ollie who refuses to play bass in Rock Band.
Happy Feet Review;3.9;Bad; Even kids who loved the animated film won't find Happy Feet to be worth their time.;Kevin VanOrd has a cat named Ollie who refuses to play bass in Rock Band.
Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas Review;8.7;Great; Rainbow Six is reinvented and reinvigorated for a new age thanks to beautiful visuals and top-notch tactical shooting action.;
Polarium Advance Review;7;Good; The follow-up to a tile-flipping puzzle game for the Nintendo DS features a simple, challenging design that makes up for a bare-bones presentation.;
The Sims 2: Pets Review;5.6;Mediocre; The Sims 2: Pets for the PSP might have been a decent port of the console versions, if it would've just stopped loading for a second.;
Happy Feet Review;3.5;Bad; Happy Feet on the DS is oriented around sledding and tap-dancing. Neither aspect is any good.;
Dominions 3: The Awakening Review;8.2;Great; Dominions 3 is a complex, deep, and incredibly rich strategy game that will reward those willing to invest in it with an almost unlimited variety of play.;
Platypus Review;6.8;Fair; Platypus is a simplistic, short-lived shoot-'em-up with visuals and gameplay that are adequate rather than impressive.;
Happy Feet Review;6.1;Fair; Cute penguins and dance segments similar to those found in Konami's Dance Dance Revolution are the high points of this game that's based on an animated movie.;
Columns Review;5.9;Mediocre; This old Tetris-inspired puzzler wasn't very special back when it was first released in 1990, and that aspect of it hasn't aged a bit.;
The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess Review;8.9;Great; Twilight Princess contains the same expertly designed puzzles and gameplay that you've come to expect, though parts of its presentation feel stuck in the past.;Jeff Gerstmann is a co-founder and editor at Giant Bomb.
One Piece: Pirates Carnival Review;5.4;Mediocre; Despite cramming in a respectable amount of licensed material, weak minigames and a plodding pace mean this ship bilges on its anchor.;
Elebits Review;7.5;Good; This hybrid of a shooter and hide-and-go-seek works best as a demonstration for what the Wii's motion sensing technology--though it's not a half bad game, either.;
Flyboys Review;3.5;Bad; This movie-licensed World War I dogfighter takes off, stalls, and nosedives straight into the ground.;
College Hoops 2K7 Review;7;Good; College Hoops 2K7 is a good college basketball game, but it's nearly identical to College Hoops 2K6.;
One Piece: Pirates Carnival Review;5.4;Mediocre; Despite cramming in a respectable amount of licensed material, weak minigames and a plodding pace mean this ship bilges on its anchor.;
Dance Dance Revolution Ultramix 4 Review;7;Good; Ultramix 4 has all of the modes you'd expect from a DDR game, but whether or not any of that is worthwhile depends on how you feel about the song ...;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Yggdra Union Review;8;Great; An alternative to the blueprint for strategy role-playing games, Yggdra Union is strange, complicated, interesting, and charming.;
EA Replay Review;5.7;Mediocre; EA Replay contains a few genuine classics, but most of these 16-bit games haven't aged well, which makes them hard to come back to.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Full Auto 2: Battlelines Review;5.7;Mediocre; Full Auto 2 is technically proficient, but almost every aspect of this car combat game's gameplay is messed up in one way or another.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Eragon Review;6.3;Fair; Eragon has some exciting moments, but they are overshadowed by frustrating controls and tedious level designs.;
Super Swing Golf Review;6.8;Fair; Super Swing offers a quirky experience that may strike a chord with some players, but will probably turn off anyone looking for a traditional round of golf.;
Eragon Review;6.4;Fair; Eragon is short and the touch-screen controls don't work very well, but it's still a fairly decent action adventure game.;
Barnyard Review;7.2;Good; While the motion-sensitive controls don't fully justify the Wii version's higher price tag, they do make a fun sandbox game seem even more engaging.;
Ice Age 2: The Meltdown Review;7;Good; The motion controls don't fundamentally change this movie-licensed platformer, but they don't get in the way either, and the adventure is still a breezily fun one.;
Mercury Meltdown Remix Review;7.2;Good; Mercury Meltdown Remix is a handheld puzzler that feels ill suited for the PS2, but because the underlying puzzle designs are so good, the game still mostly works.;
Pocket Racers Review;3.4;Bad; Fans of sluggish frame rates and clichÌ©d combat racers pay attention: Pocket Racers is the game for you.;
Assault Heroes Review;7.9;Good; Assault Heroes takes several cues from the great arcade shooters of the '80s and '90s but manages to spin all of these influences into a unique-feeling product.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Ice Hockey Review;7.1;Good; Ice Hockey is almost every bit as fun now as it was in 1988.;
Star Trek: Legacy Review;5.8;Mediocre; This starship combat game simply can't overcome bad controls, frustrating mission designs, and a mess of bugs.;
SingStar Rocks! Review;7.2;Good; SingStar's American debut presents a decent song list and sparse but functional game modes that amount to a reasonably entertaining karaoke package.;
Capcom Classics Collection Vol. 2 Review;7.5;Good; Capcom Classics Collection 2 isn't as hit-driven as the first game, but the hits that are present hit very hard, indeed.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Super Robot Taisen: Original Generation 2 Review;8.4;Great; Best suited for anyone fortunate to have played the previous game, Original Generation 2 is a great little space opera in its own right.;
Tomb Raider: Legend Review;7.6;Good; Tomb Raider: Legend offers a good mix of gunplay and puzzles;
Rayman Raving Rabbids Review;7.1;Good; Rayman Raving Rabbids is a fairly simple collection of minigames that manages to win you over largely on the merit of its personality.;
Tomb Raider: Legend Review;7;Good; Tomb Raider: Legend delivers a solid platforming experience that manages to mix in a healthy dose of the gunplay and puzzles that the console versions contained.;
Teen Titans Review;6.6;Fair; Teen Titans the game makes good use of the license to spice up what is otherwise a very average beat-'em-up.;
Warhammer: Battle for Atluma Review;5.5;Mediocre; Battle of Atluma gets the WarCry card-game mechanics down cold. Unfortunately, the chill permeates every aspect of the presentation.;Kevin VanOrd has a cat named Ollie who refuses to play bass in Rock Band.
Capcom Classics Collection Vol. 2 Review;7.5;Good; Capcom Classics Collection 2 isn't as hit-driven as the first game, but the hits that are present hit very hard, indeed.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
RoboBlitz Review;7;Good; RoboBlitz is easily the most ambitious game released for the Xbox Live Arcade so far, and it's an impressive 3D platformer in its own right.;
History Channel: Civil War Review;5.2;Mediocre; History Channel: Civil War is good for a few mindless hours of shooting action, but not much else. History buffs need not apply.;
History Channel: Civil War Review;5.5;Mediocre; History Channel: Civil War is good for a few mindless hours of shooting action, but not much else. History buffs need not apply.;
Eragon Review;4.2;Poor; Eragon relies entirely on tedious, unenthusiastic gameplay that's way too shallow to sustain interest for more than a few minutes.;
History Channel: Civil War Review;5.3;Mediocre; History Channel: Civil War is good for a few mindless hours of shooting action, but not much else. History buffs need not apply.;
IGPX: Immortal Grand Prix Review;5.9;Mediocre; If you can make it past IGPX's terrible presentation and steep learning curve, you just might find an inexplicably satisfying mech-combat racing game.;
Eragon Review;4.4;Poor; Eragon relies entirely on tedious, unenthusiastic gameplay that's way too shallow to sustain interest for more than a few minutes.;
Eragon Review;4.4;Poor; Eragon relies entirely on tedious, unenthusiastic gameplay that's way too shallow to sustain interest for more than a few minutes.;
Bonk's Adventure Review;6.6;Fair; Bonk's Adventure is a short and easy platformer, and while it still holds up pretty well, it's difficult to recommend in earnest.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Tony Hawk's Project 8 Review;6.6;Fair; Project 8 makes some odd control changes that will stick out to longtime fans of this skateboarding series, but the core game is still fairly good.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
World Championship Poker: Featuring Howard Lederer - All In Review;5.2;Mediocre; The Xbox 360 has its share of poker titles, but none are as distinctly flawed as WCP: All In.;
Superman Returns: The Videogame Review;2.3;Terrible; Superman Returns for the DS is a terrible game for numerous reasons.;
Monster Bomber Review;6.9;Fair; Monster Bomber isn't as complicated as some puzzlers, but its quick pace and hands-on nature are undeniably appealing.;
Tony Hawk's Project 8 Review;6.6;Fair; Project 8 makes some odd control changes that will stick out to longtime fans of this skateboarding series, but the core game is still fairly good.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Eragon Review;4.4;Poor; Eragon relies entirely on tedious, unenthusiastic gameplay that's way too shallow to sustain interest for more than a few minutes.;
Star Wars: Lethal Alliance Review;7.1;Good; The shooting elements are uninspired, but Lethal Alliance features enough variety to please action and Star Wars fans alike.;Kevin VanOrd has a cat named Ollie who refuses to play bass in Rock Band.
Sonic Rivals Review;6.9;Fair; Sonic Rivals keeps it simple and offers plenty of high-speed thrills, though it also has its share of frustrating moments.;
World Series of Poker: Tournament of Champions Review;5.8;Mediocre; The things Tournament of Champions does well aren't quite enough to make it stand out from the many, many other poker games available.;
RoboBlitz Review;7;Good; RoboBlitz may be short, but it's also one great-looking, catchy grab bag of classic 3D platform challenges.;
Eureka Seven - Vol. 1: The New Wave Review;4.9;Poor; Eureka Seven is so wildly uneven and devoid of decent gameplay that only the most forgiving fans will be able to tolerate it.;
Superman Returns: Fortress of Solitude Review;6;Fair; Fortress of Solitude is a passable puzzler that offers a decent selection of Sudoku-style puzzles.;
Fight Night Round 3 Review;8.2;Great; Fight Night Round 3 features the same great gameplay the franchise is known for as well as a few minor, but appreciable, additions exclusive to the PlayStation 3.;
Capcom Classics Collection Reloaded Review;7.1;Good; Capcom's latest PSP compilation has some emulation issues, but there's enough of the good stuff on the disc to make it worth checking out.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Corvette Evolution GT Review;6.9;Fair; It may not look like much, but for a budget-priced game, Corvette Evolution GT actually offers enough enjoyable racing to make it worth a look.;
Justice League Heroes Review;7.6;Good; It's a familiar formula, but Justice League Heroes offers something interesting by blending dungeon-crawling convention with comic book heroics.;
Zatch Bell! Mamodo Fury Review;4.8;Poor; Mamodo Fury packs a number of gameplay modes and plenty of familiar characters, but it all feels wasted on this shallow and frustrating fighting game.;
Sonic Riders Review;6.2;Fair; Sonic Riders can occasionally be quite entertaining, but too many of those entertaining moments are overridden by bouts of frustration and weak mechanics.;
Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops Review;9;Superb; Just what the PSP needed, this latest Metal Gear delivers on all fronts with an excellent story, a deep campaign, and a complete set of multiplayer features.;
Avatar: The Last Airbender Review;5.9;Mediocre; Avatar had the potential to be an enjoyable game, but extremely repetitive and tedious gameplay mean that most of that potential went untapped.;
Eagle Eye Golf Review;5.2;Mediocre; Eagle Eye Golf is a lot like Hot Shots Golf, but not nearly as good.;
The Elder Scrolls IV: Knights of the Nine Review;8.3;Great; This retail package containing Bethesda's downloadable content updates for its groundbreaking role-playing game gives you more quality for a budget price.;
NRA Gun Club Review;1.6;Abysmal; NRA Gun Club's awful gameplay and presentation make it an effective though unintended antigun message: Guns are boring.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Rapala Tournament Fishing Review;4.5;Poor; The controller may fit the bill, but Rapala Tournament Fishing just isn't the big catch that virtual anglers were hoping for.;
Avatar: The Last Airbender Review;5.9;Mediocre; Avatar had the potential to be an enjoyable game, but extremely repetitive and tedious gameplay mean that most of that potential went untapped.;
Cars Review;7;Good; Steering Cars with the Wii Remote works pretty nicely, but some of the minigame control schemes and a few bugs conspire to drag down this film-licensed racer.;
Avatar: The Last Airbender Review;5.6;Mediocre; Avatar had the potential to be an enjoyable game, but extremely repetitive and tedious gameplay mean that most of that potential went untapped.;
Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 2 Review;6.5;Fair; Burdened by clumsy controls and predictable artificial intelligence, Tenkaichi 2 is a game that can be loved only by forgiving DBZ fans.;
Heroes of Annihilated Empires Review;6;Fair; The colorful presentational coating is tasty, but unfinished features and rotten AI keep Heroes of Annihilated Empires from reaching its potential.;Kevin VanOrd has a cat named Ollie who refuses to play bass in Rock Band.
Kirby Squeak Squad  Review;7.7;Good; Though Kirby Squeak Squad rarely finds a way to challenge you, it's a clever and cute enough platformer to recommend to most DS owners.;
Big Bumpin' Review;5.3;Mediocre; Big Bumpin' might have worked as a part of a large minigame collection, but on its own, it's sort of lame.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin Review;8.3;Great; Portrait of Ruin is a great game because it stays true to the familiar Castlevania design and delivers a fun, lengthy adventure.;
The Lord of the Rings The Battle for Middle-earth II The Rise of the Witch-King Review;7.3;Good; The Rise of the Witch-King is a fairly standard expansion that adds a brief campaign centered around one of the more enigmatic characters from the movies.;
Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Double Agent Review;6.2;Fair; Take the complicated controls of this popular series and make them even more finicky, then lose the online versus mode, and you get Double Agent for the Wii.;
Open Season Review;3.9;Bad; Open Season was a mediocre adventure game on the GameCube, and it's even worse on the Wii thanks to the cruddy controls and higher price tag.;
Avatar: The Last Airbender Review;5.9;Mediocre; Avatar had the potential to be an enjoyable game, but extremely repetitive and tedious gameplay mean that most of that potential went untapped.;
Pocketbike Racer Review;5.1;Mediocre; Pocketbike Racer is a bad kart-racing game that's often broken.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Gothic 3 Review;7.6;Good; If you can get past its technical issues, Gothic 3 offers a substantial, open-ended role-playing experience.;
Pokemon Ranger Review;7.5;Good; PokÌ©mon Ranger has a similar look and feel to all the other lighthearted PokÌ©mon games, but invites you to capture all those critters in a rather exciting new way.;
Scurge: Hive Review;7.7;Good; Scurge: Hive is a solid action adventure with a slick presentation that should appeal to anyone who enjoys the Metroid style of play.;
Golden Axe Review;6.5;Fair; Golden Axe is an influential arcade classic, and the Sega Genesis version kept its intense hack-and-slash gameplay intact, so it's still fun to pick up and play.;
Bionicle Heroes Review;5.1;Mediocre; Not even the allure of shiny robots with guns for arms can liven up this mind-numbingly simplistic and repetitive over-the-shoulder shooter.;
Bionicle Heroes Review;5.2;Mediocre; Not even the allure of shiny robots with guns for arms can liven up this mind-numbingly simplistic and repetitive over-the-shoulder shooter.;
Bionicle Heroes Review;5.2;Mediocre; Not even the allure of shiny robots with guns for arms can liven up this mind-numbingly simplistic and repetitive over-the-shoulder shooter.;

Bomberman '93 Review;7.4;Good; Bomberman '93 is a perfect fit for the Wii's party-game mentality, and has the multiplayer support it needs to get you hooked all over again.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Harley-Davidson Motorcycles: Race to the Rally Review;2.4;Terrible; An insult to Harley fans and racing-game aficionados, this game should be avoided at all costs.;
Scurge: Hive Review;7.8;Good; Scurge: Hive is a solid action adventure with a slick presentation that should appeal to anyone who enjoys the Metroid style of play.;

College Hoops 2K7 Review;7;Good; College Hoops 2K7 is a good college basketball game, but it's nearly identical to College Hoops 2K6.;
College Hoops 2K7 Review;7.9;Good; College Hoops 2K7 is a very good college basketball game, but its value is somewhat lessened by the fact that it follows College Hoops 2K6 by just eight months.;
Need for Speed Carbon Review;7.1;Good; Need for Speed Carbon contains some unique driving control options, but none of them can escape the sensation that this game simply wasn't built for motion control.;
WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW 2007 Review;7.9;Good; What SmackDown! vs. RAW 2007 improves isn't necessarily what the series actually needed to improve, but on its own merits, it's still a very good wrestling game.;
Soccer Review;2.2;Terrible; It wasn't very good when it hit the NES in 1987, and it's even less fun in 2006.;
Solomon's Key Review;7.4;Good; Solomon's Key holds up surprisingly well after all these years, thanks to its interesting mix of action and puzzles.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Call of Duty 3 Review;8.2;Great; Call of Duty 3 isn't just another first-person shooter that takes place during World War II. It's a fantastic game with great online play and top-notch sound.;
Gitaroo Man Lives! Review;7.7;Good; It's a straightforward remake of Koei's cult-favorite rhythm game, but Gitaroo Man still knows how to rock.;
The Sopranos: Road to Respect Review;4.2;Poor; Road to Respect shoehorns the Sopranos license into a clumsy, poorly designed action game that isn't the least bit enjoyable to play.;
Final Fantasy III Review;7.9;Good; Not only is this a nicely done remake of an influential, little-seen early chapter from this long-running role-playing series, it's also an all-around solid RPG.;
Rush Review;5.4;Mediocre; Rush is a middling street racing game that really wasn't worth your time when it was released on consoles last year, and certainly isn't worth your time now.;
EverQuest II: Echoes of Faydwer Review;7.5;Good; Echoes of Faydwer is EverQuest II's most appealing expansion yet, thanks to a new continent, a new race, and a wealth of new content to round them out.;Kevin VanOrd has a cat named Ollie who refuses to play bass in Rock Band.
Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Double Agent Review;6.1;Fair; Even those who only own a GameCube should probably avoid this version of Double Agent, which has fewer features and worse graphics than on other platforms.;
Activision Hits Remixed Review;7.4;Good; Activision Hits Remixed has a lot of great, old 2600 games in it, and it's selling for a nice, low price.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Every Extend Extra Review;6.7;Fair; The developer behind Lumines and Meteos brings more of its trippy, trademark style, but it neglects to deliver equally compelling gameplay.;
Call of Duty 3 Review;8.2;Great; Call of Duty 3 isn't just another first-person shooter that takes place during World War II. It's a fantastic game with great online play and top-notch sound;
Brigade E5: New Jagged Union Review;3.5;Bad; Subtitle or not, this ain't the second coming of Jagged Alliance.;
Pinball Review;4.5;Poor; This is a perfect emulation of Pinball. But Pinball wasn't a very good game, even when it was brand-new.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Star Trek: Tactical Assault Review;6.2;Fair; Star Trek: Tactical Assault is a neat idea but doesn't offer much strategy--or much Star Trek.;Kevin VanOrd has a cat named Ollie who refuses to play bass in Rock Band.
Tamagotchi Connection: Corner Shop 2 Review;6.7;Fair; Corner Shop 2 has an appealing look and minigames that are fun at first, but the gameplay quickly wears thin because there's nothing to keep you playing.;
Asphalt: Urban GT 2 Review;7.5;Good; Asphalt: Urban GT 2 is a fun and visually impressive arcade-style racer, even if it is just an evolutionary upgrade of the original game.;
Mortal Kombat: Unchained Review;6.4;Fair; Based on Mortal Kombat: Deception, this version gains some extra characters but little else to make it worthwhile for fans of Midway's gory fighting-game series.;
Left Behind: Eternal Forces Review;3.4;Bad; Another good thing about the Rapture is that it will take you away from disastrous, buggy games like Left Behind: Eternal Forces.;
SimCity Review;7.4;Good; SimCity is one of those true classics that remain fun and addictive years after their original release.;
Monster 4x4: World Circuit Review;4;Poor; New driving controls add barely a smidgen of excitement to this Wii port of a thoroughly boring monster truck racer.;

Konductra Review;4.2;Poor; Konductra‰Ûªs fussy design and minimal production values make playing it feel more like a job than a game.;Kevin VanOrd has a cat named Ollie who refuses to play bass in Rock Band.
Small Arms Review;6;Fair; With its focus on weapon grabbing over weapon firing, Small Arms' shallow gameplay falls flat.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.

Snoopy vs. the Red Baron Review;7.3;Good; Don't let the license fool you. Snoopy's game is loaded with intense air combat that players of any age can appreciate.;
Tomb Raider: Legend Review;7.8;Good; Tomb Raider: Legend is a very good action adventure game on the GameCube, which makes it all the more disappointing that it ends so quickly.;
Need for Speed Carbon Review;7.4;Good; Even though the wingman mechanics and canyon races don't quite pan out, it's still a stylish and enjoyable street racer.;
Mario Bros. Review;4.9;Poor; The NES version of Mario Bros. can be fun for a little while with two players, but it doesn't measure up to the seminal arcade hit it's based on.;
Sonic the Hedgehog Review;4.4;Poor; Sonic the Hedgehog may share its name with the Genesis original, but this game is even more broken than most of the other recent Sonic games have been.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
ArchLord Review;2.7;Terrible; You probably shouldn't play ArchLord.;
Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas Review;9.1;Superb; Rainbow Six is reinvented and reinvigorated for a new age thanks to beautiful visuals and top-notch tactical shooting action.;

The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy Review;6.6;Fair; This game is surprisingly enjoyable for a few hours, but after that it goes from good, mindless fun to mind-numbingly repetitive.;
Devil May Cry 3: Special Edition Review;7.1;Good; Though it's like a fish out of water on the PC, this straight port of a great, gruelingly fast and intense PlayStation 2 action adventure game can still be exciting.;
Donkey Kong Review;4.6;Poor; Even for its time, the Nintendo Entertainment System version of this all-time classic wasn't nearly as good as the 1981 original. So why pay for it now?;
Thrillville Review;7.6;Good; Thanks to its rock-solid execution, Thrillville delivers an enjoyable batch of minigames in a lighthearted theme park environment.;

Marvel: Ultimate Alliance Review;7.1;Good; The tacked-on motion controls and lack of online support take some of the shine off this otherwise dependable superhero adventure.;
NFL Street 3 Review;6.9;Fair; There is some fun to be had in NFL Street 3 for newcomers, but Street vets have seen it all before.;
Blitz: The League Review;7.4;Good; Blitz on the Xbox 360 is the same addictive, violent game of football that it was last year. But after a year's time, you'd hope for a bit more than ...;
Gunpey Review;7.7;Good; Gunpey's pulsing music and visuals may remind you of Lumines, but don't let it fool you: This addictive game is unique and bizarre enough to stand on its own merits.;Kevin VanOrd has a cat named Ollie who refuses to play bass in Rock Band.
Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Double Agent Review;8;Great; Agent Sam Fisher's latest assignment is a fairly routine stealth action operation, but changes to Splinter Cell's innovative multiplayer mode help make up for this.;
Dave Mirra BMX Challenge Review;3.9;Bad; The biggest challenge found in this uninspiring BMX game is actually enjoying it.;
The Sims 2: Pets Review;4.5;Poor; The Sims 2: Pets for the DS feels limited and repetitive, and it lacks the heart that any good pet-care sim must have.;
The Secret Files: Tunguska Review;6.2;Fair; MacGyver-esque inventory puzzles make this an acceptable, if exceedingly conventional, adventure.;
Sonic the Hedgehog Genesis Review;2.5;Terrible; Jumpy graphics transform this classic side-scroller into a crushing disappointment.;
Sonic the Hedgehog Review;7.3;Good; Sega's classic mascot got his start in this influential platformer, which is still very fast, tough, and fun to play.;
Thrillville Review;7.7;Good; Thanks to its rock-solid execution, Thrillville delivers an enjoyable batch of minigames in a lighthearted theme park environment.;
Rayman Raving Rabbids Review;8;Great; More than just Mario Party with a different mascot, Rayman Raving Rabbids makes great use of the Wii technology to create a bizarrely enjoyable minigame collection.;
Call of Duty 3 Review;7.2;Good; Call of Duty 3 for the Wii manages to overcome its lack of multiplayer and a sometimes-unwieldy control scheme with an exciting and enjoyable single-player campaign.;
F-Zero Review;8;Great; F-Zero once raised the bar for what could be expected from both racing games and the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, and it's still great after all these years.;
Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam Review;6;Fair; Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam is a passable but unexciting racing game that substitutes the finesse of the other Tony Hawk games for simple and scattered action.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Wii Sports Review;7.8;Good; Wii Sports makes for an ideal pack-in with Nintendo's new console, providing some fun, simple gameplay that's accessible to almost anyone.;
Madden NFL 07 Review;8.4;Great; Madden NFL 07 for the Wii isn't just a quick-and-dirty port. It's an excellent use of the Wii's motion-sensing capabilities that revitalizes Madden in many ways.;
Altered Beast Review;5.2;Mediocre; In its day, the Genesis version of Altered Beast was a middling translation of a great arcade game. Now it scrapes by on decent action and some nostalgic value.;
Blast Factor Review;6.6;Fair; Blast Factor has some exciting moments and offers a unique twist on a familiar formula, but it still ends up feeling generic and forgettable.;
GT Pro Series Review;5.1;Mediocre; It doesn't take long to get over the novelty of the included steering wheel, and beyond that this is a very unremarkable racing game that isn't much fun.;
Cash Guns Chaos Review;4.7;Poor; Cash Guns Chaos is less a loving tribute to the Smash TV brand of shooter and more a cheesy knockoff with an irritating sense of style.;
Untold Legends: Dark Kingdom Review;6;Fair; Dark Kingdom is an unremarkable hack-and-slash game whose most noteworthy feature seems to be that it's coming out at the launch of the PS3.;
NFL Street 3 Review;6.9;Fair; There is some fun to be had in NFL Street 3 for newcomers, but Street vets have seen it all before.;
Ridge Racer 7 Review;8;Great; Ridge Racer 7 introduces some great new additions that make this the most significant update Namco's arcade-style racing series has seen in years.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.

NBA 2K7 Review;8.2;Great; Though not without flaws, NBA 2K7 is a great basketball simulation.;
Warhammer: Mark of Chaos Review;7.2;Good; Mark of Chaos captures the fantasy combat of the Warhammer franchise in a beautiful way, but it's marred by some technical issues and a basic strategic campaign.;
Rampage: Total Destruction Review;5.1;Mediocre; Shoehorning in the most basic of Wii motion-sensing controls doesn't make a clunky, repetitive game like Rampage fun--if anything, it just makes it more annoying.;
Madden NFL 07 Review;7.9;Good; Madden NFL 07 delivers a very good game of football in the series' PlayStation 3 debut.;
Red Steel Review;5.5;Mediocre; Red Steel introduces a promising control scheme for shooting thugs and for slashing them with samurai swords, but wraps it in a buggy, thoroughly unimpressive game.;
Mobile Suit Gundam: Crossfire Review;3.9;Bad; Mobile Suit Gundam: Crossfire is a lazy attempt to bring the Gundam license to the PlayStation 3, and it's a disappointment in almost every way.;
Birth of America Review;6.9;Fair; Birth of America's challenging AI and historical authenticity will please grizzled wargamers, but it doesn't do enough to broaden the genre's appeal to newcomers.;Kevin VanOrd has a cat named Ollie who refuses to play bass in Rock Band.
Resistance: Fall of Man Review;8.6;Great; Resistance successfully combines many of the best qualities from other great first-person shooters with spectacular visuals and a few novel twists.;
Final Fantasy V Advance Review;8.5;Great; Fans may now experience what they've missed out on for years in this relatively obscure but thoroughly excellent installment of the classic role-playing series.;
Viva Pinata Review;8.3;Great; Viva PiÌ±ata is a game that can be enjoyed by players of any age and certainly shouldn't be dismissed because of its colorful visual style.;
Excite Truck Review;6.8;Fair; Ultimately, Excite Truck feels more like a tech demo than a full-fledged game.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
NBA 07 Review;4.9;Poor; NBA 07 on the PlayStation 3 doesn't have the fun story mode that the PlayStation 2 version has, but it does have most of that version's flaws, and some new ...;
Super Monkey Ball: Banana Blitz Review;8.3;Great; Banana Blitz stands as one of the first, best proofs of what the Wii is capable of.;
NHL 2K7 Review;8.3;Great; NHL 2K7 might be your only choice for a hockey game to go with your new PlayStation 3, but it's still a great one.;
Evidence: The Last Ritual Review;6.8;Fair; Evidence is an experimental serial-killer tale that will raise goose bumps and tempers.;
Trauma Center: Second Opinion Review;8;Great; You don't need a surgeon's patience or precision to appreciate this quirky, inventive, very likable remake of a remarkable Nintendo DS game.;
Medieval 2: Total War Review;8.8;Great;" ""Epic"" doesn't quite begin to describe the scope and scale of the latest Total War game--there's a lot of strategic depth, with plenty of amazing combat to enjoy.";
Call of Duty 3 Review;8.2;Great; Though it plays like many other WWII-based first-person shooters, Call of Duty 3 is a great game with top-notch production values.;
Dead or Alive Xtreme 2 Review;5.9;Mediocre; Your enjoyment of Dead or Alive Xtreme 2 will be directly proportional to your interest in lusting over ridiculously idealized polygonal female models.;
Need for Speed Carbon Review;7.6;Good; Need for Speed Carbon is an enjoyable and stylish street racer that offers plenty of customization options and a few sweet gamebreaker features.;
Children of Mana Review;5.8;Mediocre; The shallow, repetitive gameplay of Children of Mana negates any nostalgic charm that the game might have attempted to capture.;
Lumines II Review;8.4;Great; Tons of content and great music make Lumines II a worthy follow-up to the addictive original.;
Contra Review;6.6;Fair; This is an accurate emulation of the arcade version of Contra. Unfortunately, you're probably not looking for the arcade version of Contra.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Star Trek: Encounters Review;4.3;Poor; Not even William Shatner and a budget price can rescue this licensed disaster.;Kevin VanOrd has a cat named Ollie who refuses to play bass in Rock Band.
Yoshi's Island DS Review;9.1;Superb; Yoshi's Island DS is a terrific platformer that‰Ûªs every bit as fun and charming as its predecessor.;
WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW 2007 Review;8.1;Great; What SmackDown! vs. RAW 2007 improves isn't necessarily what the series actually needed to improve, but on its own merits, it's still a great wrestling game.;
WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW 2007 Review;8.1;Great; What SmackDown! vs. RAW 2007 improves isn't necessarily what the series actually needed to improve, but on its own merits, it's still a great wrestling game.;
Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam Review;6.8;Fair; Downhill Jam shifts away from the trick-heavy gameplay of old and turns Tony Hawk into a racer--and a fairly decent one at that.;
Need for Speed Carbon: Own the City Review;7.9;Good; Own the City is a very different game from the console versions of Need for Speed Carbon, but it's still an exciting racer in its own right.;
Star Trek: Tactical Assault Review;6.2;Fair; Star Trek: Tactical Assault is a neat idea but doesn't offer much strategy--or much Star Trek, for that matter.;Kevin VanOrd has a cat named Ollie who refuses to play bass in Rock Band.
Jaws Unleashed Review;3.8;Bad; Jaws Unleashed was a truly awful game on consoles, and it's no better six months later on the PC.;
Stronghold Legends Review;4.3;Poor; Say good-bye to the historical authenticity of Strongholds past and hello to one generic, seriously flawed fantasy RTS.;
FIFA 07 Review;8.1;Great; FIFA 07 is the best Xbox 360 game in the series to date, boasting plenty of options for solo and social players alike.;
Genji: Days of the Blade Review;6.4;Fair; While this action adventure game flexes a bit of the PlayStation 3's graphical muscle, its rather shallow, derivative gameplay makes it difficult to recommend.;
Need for Speed Carbon: Own the City Review;6.5;Fair; Carbon on the GBA is a decent racer in its own right, but it doesn't provide the amount of excitement or attitude that the other versions of the game do.;
SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs Fireteam Bravo 2 Review;8.3;Great; Fireteam Bravo 2 delivers a solid single-player campaign backed up by a fully-featured online multiplayer game, making it one of the best shooters on the PSP.;
1701 A.D. Review;7.6;Good; Great design and atmosphere make this game about Caribbean colonization one of the better city builders to come down the pike in some time.;
SOCOM: U.S. Navy Seals: Combined Assault Review;8.2;Great; Combined Assault offers the same great gameplay of its predecessors along with a lengthy single-player campaign that can also be played cooperatively.;
Call of Duty 3 Review;8.8;Great; Though it plays nearly identical to Call of Duty 2, Call of Duty 3 is a fantastic game with top-notch production values.;
Guild Wars Nightfall Review;8.2;Great; Unmistakably similar to the previous two games in the innovative Guild Wars series, Nightfall features an impressive new Egyptian-themed continent to explore.;
Elite Beat Agents Review;8.9;Great; You won't find a stranger and more addictive rhythm game on a handheld system than Elite Beat Agents.;
Tony Hawk's Project 8 Review;7.9;Good; Project 8 makes a lot of changes that will please fans of the series, but a few technical issues keep it from being as great as it could have been.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Contact Review;6.7;Fair; A promisingly strange premise gives Contact a strong start, but the often-boring combat and exploration sequences that ensue just don't live up to it.;

Tony Hawk's Project 8 Review;7.3;Good; Project 8 makes a lot of changes that will please fans of the series, but some technical issues and missing features hurt the experience.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.

Gears of War Review;9.6;Superb; Gears of War is an outstanding technical achievement, but in addition to looking and sounding amazing, it's a seriously awesome action game.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Guitar Hero II Review;8.7;Great; It might not make quite the same impact that its predecessor did, but Guitar Hero II brings the rock heavier and faster than ever before.;
ParaWorld Review;6.2;Fair; Even dinosaurs, ninjas, and Vikings can't really elevate this real-time strategy game above its generic roots.;
Marvel Ultimate Alliance Review;8.3;Great; Raven improves upon the great work it did with the X-Men Legends games, with a lengthy adventure that touches upon nearly every last corner of the Marvel Universe.;
Space Empires V Review;6.6;Fair; Space Empires V is a space strategy game with plenty of depth and complexity, but it's so riddled with bugs and issues that it is ultimately tough to recommend.;
Phantasy Star Universe Review;6.8;Fair; Phantasy Star Universe almost immediately feels dated, and the monthly fee is way too steep to justify, but at its core, it's still an enjoyable experience.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Flushed Away Review;6;Fair; Flushed Away for the Nintendo DS is a decent 3D side-scroller, but there isn't much more than a couple of hours of play built into it.;
Flushed Away Review;3.6;Bad; Flushed Away for the GBA is a dull, repetitive side-scroller that deserves to be flushed away.;
Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories Review;8.4;Great; Vice City Stories is more like a sidestep for the franchise--it's a great deal of typical GTA fun, but doesn't really move the series forward in any meaningful way.;
Flushed Away Review;4.3;Poor; Flushed Away is a generic run-and-jump game that's hampered by technical problems.;
Flushed Away Review;4.3;Poor; Flushed Away is a generic run-and-jump game that's hampered by technical problems.;
El Matador Review;5.1;Mediocre; It's fast-paced, it's gritty, and it's got style to spare, but El Matador is also one of the most infuriatingly unbalanced shooters in years.;
Need for Speed Carbon Review;7.4;Good; Even though the wingman mechanics and canyon races don't quite pan out, it's still a stylish and enjoyable street racer.;
NBA Live '07 Review;5.9;Mediocre; NBA Live 07 isn't much different from last year's game, and the numerous bugs and glitches make it not much fun to play.;
Power Stone Collection Review;7.3;Good; If you can find friends to play with, and can tolerate the long load times, there's some sturdy brawling to be had here.;
Need for Speed Carbon Review;7.6;Good; Even though the wingman mechanics and canyon races don't quite pan out, it's still a stylish and enjoyable street racer.;
Need for Speed Carbon Review;7.6;Good; Even though the wingman mechanics and canyon races don't quite pan out, it's still a stylish and enjoyable street racer.;
Neverwinter Nights 2 Review;8.6;Great; Neverwinter Nights 2 isn't without some technical issues, but the engaging, dynamic story and proven D & D framework make it an RPG that shouldn't be missed.;
F.E.A.R. Review;8.6;Great; This straightforward translation of last year's hit PC game blends kinetic action with creepy atmosphere to create one of the most intense shooters on the Xbox 360.;
ProStroke Golf - World Tour 2007 Review;5.3;Mediocre; ProStroke Golf - World Tour 2007 is a deeply flawed game that fails to bring anything new to the world of golf games.;

Need for Speed Carbon Review;7.4;Good; Even though the wingman mechanics and canyon races don't quite pan out, it's still a stylish and enjoyable street racer.;
Need for Speed Carbon Review;7.6;Good; Even though the wingman mechanics and canyon races don't quite pan out, it's still a stylish and enjoyable street racer.;
ATV Offroad Fury 4 Review;8.1;Great; The ATV Offroad Fury series has long been known for fast, dirty thrills, and ATV4 is the best so far.;
Nacho Libre Review;5.7;Mediocre; Nacho Libre earns some style points for its patently insane cutscenes and use of video clips from the movie. Just don't expect to have any fun actually playing it.;
Justice League Heroes Review;5;Mediocre; Justice League Heroes is a halfhearted beat-'em-up game that does very little to make you feel as if you're controlling your favorite comic book characters.;

Killzone: Liberation Review;8.3;Great; Killzone is reborn in this consistently intense, periodically infuriating, yet undeniably enjoyable handheld tactical shooter.;
Magical Starsign Review;7.3;Good; Magical Starsign is a lighthearted role-playing adventure that partially makes up for a lack of gameplay depth with its quirky, oddball world.;

The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning Review;5.8;Mediocre; The title may say that this is a new beginning, but Spyro's latest adventure isn't much more than a collection of tired, overused platforming clichÌ©s.;

Justice League Heroes Review;7.6;Good; It's a familiar formula, but Justice League Heroes offers something interesting by blending dungeon-crawling convention with comic book heroics.;

.hack//G.U. vol. 1//Rebirth Review;6.3;Fair; Rebirth makes some minor improvements on the familiar formula, but it's still hampered by repetitive, tedious gameplay and a story that never seems to get anywhere.;
F.E.A.R. Extraction Point Review;7.8;Good; Extraction Point offers up about five more hours of the intense F.E.A.R. gameplay, but that's pretty much it.;
Cars Review;7;Good; There's not much new about Cars for the Xbox 360 to justify its higher price or late arrival, but it's still a good, solid driving game for a younger audience.;
Star Wars: Empire at War: Forces of Corruption Review;8.1;Great; Forces of Corruption is a great addition to the Empire at War saga thanks to an interesting new faction that offers up a different way to conquer the galaxy.;
Reservoir Dogs Review;4.6;Poor; Neither a good action game on its own merits, nor quality fan service, Reservoir Dogs is an out and out failure.;

Reservoir Dogs Review;4.6;Poor; Neither a good action game on its own merits, nor quality fan service, Reservoir Dogs is an out and out failure.;
Family Guy Review;6.4;Fair; Though it gets the show's style of humor down pat, Family Guy is derailed by frustrating and uninteresting gameplay.;
Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Summoner - Raidou Kuzunoha vs. the Soulless Army Review;7.3;Good; The newest installment in the Shin Megami Tensei series has repetitive battles and a slow-rolling narrative, but its fascinating premise makes it worth a look.;

Bully Review;8.7;Great; Bully's unique setting and quality gameplay make for an exciting and memorable action adventure game.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Gun Showdown Review;7.4;Good; This updated, portable version of 2006's Wild West adventure introduces a few keen changes and features to make up for a few bits that were lost in translation.;
Nintendogs: Dalmatian and Friends Review;8.2;Great; Dalmatian and Friends is still a charming, endearing game, though it's also essentially the same game that was released in previous versions.;
Ace Combat X: Skies of Deception Review;8.2;Great; One of the best names in flight combat delivers another standout installment in Ace Combat X for the PSP, which has its own story and well-designed gameplay twists.;

Dynasty Warriors Vol. 2 Review;6.1;Fair; Dynasty Warriors Vol. 2 might as well be Vol. 1.5, with its few minor upgrades, less-than-enjoyable multiplayer mode, and done-to-death hack-and-slash gameplay.;

Destroy All Humans! 2 Review;7.1;Good; Killing foolish earthlings was more fun the first time, but this sarcastic sequel to last year's inventive action game is not without merit or amusement.;
Tokobot Plus: Mysteries of the Karakuri Review;7.2;Good; This slightly enhanced version of Tecmo's endearing, puzzle-heavy PSP platformer is still fun, but it feels small on the PS2.;
Greg Hastings' Tournament Paintball Max'd Review;7;Good; If you can look past the dated presentation you'll find a suprisingly fun, fast-paced game of paintball in Max'd.;

Bubble Bobble Revolution Review;3.6;Bad; One of the games included with Bubble Bobble Revolution is a genuine classic. The other is so plagued with glitches that it can't even be finished.;

Defcon: Everybody Dies Review;8.1;Great; Though not a complex strategy game, Defcon's specific sense of style makes for a compelling and unsettling experience.;
Alliance: Future Combat Review;2.3;Terrible; Alliance: Future Combat is less a look at the future and more a history lesson on what not to do when making a real-time strategy game.;
Warhammer 40000: Dawn of War - Dark Crusade Review;8.8;Great; This terrific update to one of the best sci-fi real-time strategy games in years packs in a great strategic campaign and a grand total of seven different armies.;

Stacked with Daniel Negreanu Review;7.4;Good; Stacked presents itself as a typical game of poker, but thanks to an intriguing artificial intelligence system, it plays things much smarter than your average poker title.;
Scarface: The World Is Yours Review;6.4;Fair; Once you get over the whole rewriting-the-end-of-the-movie thing, Scarface: The World Is Yours is a competent but usually uninteresting action game.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.

NHL 2K7 Review;7.8;Good; NHL 2K7 for the PlayStation 2 lacks much of the forward progress of its Xbox 360 counterpart and instead provides an enjoyable hockey game that you've pretty much played before.;
God Hand Review;8;Great; God Hand's wild sense of humor, surf rock soundtrack, and pure focus on ridiculous martial arts brawls makes this simple action game fun and challenging.;
GTR 2 Review;9;Superb; Despite a slightly gentler learning curve, GTR 2 still demands the most out of your inner race driver.;
The Fast and the Furious Review;6.6;Fair; Aside from the name, this street racer has little to distinguish itself from an already crowded field.;
Mortal Kombat: Armageddon Review;7;Good; The umpteenth Mortal Kombat game bombards you with characters and modes but does little to bring the underlying one-on-one fighting action to the next level.;
Mortal Kombat: Armageddon Review;7;Good; The umpteenth Mortal Kombat game bombards you with characters and modes but does little to bring the underlying one-on-one fighting action to the next level.;

Mage Knight: Destiny's Soldier Review;5.6;Mediocre; Mage Knight DS is based on some good design ideas derived from an interesting tabletop wargame, but they're drowned out by a poor interface and weak presentation.;

AFL Premiership 2006 Review;6.2;Fair; AFL Premiership 2006 is better than last year's game, but not by much, which makes it a disappointment overall.;Randolph is the editor in chief of GameSpot, and needs more time to play games.
Gangs of London Review;5.5;Mediocre; There's no shortage of things to do in Gangs of London--the trouble is that none of it is much fun.;

World Series of Poker: Tournament of Champions Review;6.4;Fair; The things Tournament of Champions does well aren't quite enough to make it stand out from the many, many other poker games available.;
Caesar IV Review;7.7;Good; After an eight-year absence, the Caesar series returns with a slightly flawed but very engrossing game about ancient city building.;

Zatch Bell! Mamodo Fury Review;4.8;Poor; Mamodo Fury packs a number of gameplay modes and plenty of familiar characters, but it all feels wasted on this shallow and frustrating fighting game.;
Open Season Review;7.3;Good; Open Season is a slick action game that plays like a bizarre mash-up of Metal Slug and Mario.;
NBA Live 07 Review;7.1;Good; Few changes have been made to NBA Live formula since last year, but it's still an enjoyable game with a good amount to offer.;
NBA Live 07 Review;7.3;Good; Few changes have been made to NBA Live formula since last year, but it's still an enjoyable game with a good amount to offer.;
NBA 07 Review;6.8;Fair; The Life is a flawed, yet fun basketball game that's worth a look for anyone that's searching for a different take on the sport.;
NBA Live 07 Review;6.5;Fair; Despite the addition of several previously missing modes, NBA Live 07's many gameplay flaws and uneven visuals relegate the series to the bench for yet another year.;

Rengoku II: The Stairway to H.E.A.V.E.N. Review;6.4;Fair; The game ultimately runs out of steam before it's over, but along the way, Rengoku II creates a more streamlined and interesting experience than its predecessor.;
LMA Manager 2007 Review;7.3;Good; LMA Manager 2007 is a welcoming introduction to the football management genre, with concessions for novice players and a handsome 3D match engine.;
Open Season Review;5.3;Mediocre; This rendition of Open Season is a plodding adventure full of inane fetch quests and lifeless dialogue scenes.;

Open Season Review;7.1;Good; Open Season on the PSP isn't a lengthy game, but it is fun while it lasts.;
Naruto: Clash of Ninja 2 Review;6;Fair; Clash of Ninja 2 seems more like an upgraded game than a true sequel, and it ultimately does little to improve upon the original.;
MechAssault: Phantom War Review;7.1;Good; Apart from the lack of online play, MechAssault: Phantom War brings all of the mech combat action from the Xbox to the Nintendo DS without losing much in translation.;
Doom Review;7;Good; Doom's a genuine classic, and this version of the game remains faithful to the 1993 original.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.

Joint Task Force Review;6.5;Fair; Joint Task Force's theme of modern military intervention to solve the world's ills seems fitting, as it shows how good ideas can get bogged down in reality.;
Rule of Rose Review;6;Fair; Rule of Rose trades zombies for a pack of sadistic children, but its compelling premise and creepy atmosphere only partly make up for the mostly bland gameplay.;
Faces of War Review;6;Fair; Faces of War proves that even something as formulaic as a World War II real-time strategy game can still go awry.;
Capcom Classics Mini Mix Review;6.9;Fair; Although each of these three games looks and sounds old, they're all still fun and relevant.;
Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2: March of the Minis Review;8.2;Great; The new touch-screen controls, level creator, and colorful presentation make March of the Minis an even better puzzle game than its predecessor.;
Harvest Moon DS Review;5.9;Mediocre; Aside from including some half-baked touch-screen features, Harvest Moon DS does nothing to set itself apart from previous games in the series.;
Just Cause Review;7.2;Good; Just Cause is able to justify its relative brevity and disrespect for physical law with some extremely visceral and often satisfying action.;
PokÌ©mon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team Review;5.2;Mediocre; The injection of PokÌ©mon characters and aspects hasn't done anything to improve ChunSoft's oft-copied dungeon hack.;

Cooking Mama Review;6.9;Fair; Cooking Mama is a cute, charming little cooking-themed minigame collection, but it lacks direction and depth.;
Just Cause Review;7.2;Good; Just Cause is able to justify its relative brevity and disrespect for physical law with some extremely visceral and often satisfying action.;
Ankh Review;7.3;Good; It's not quite the return of LucasArts-era cartoon adventures, but this cheerful game dishes out a lot of laughs.;
The Godfather Review;7.9;Good; The 360 version of The Godfather is a lengthy and enjoyable experience that puts the source material to great use, but it's not much of an improvement over previous versions.;
ProStroke Golf - World Tour 2007 Review;5;Mediocre; ProStroke Golf - World Tour 2007 is a deeply flawed game that fails to bring anything new to the world of golf games.;
World Racing 2 Review;4.4;Poor; World Racing 2 makes a couple of key improvements on its predecessor, but it's still a substandard effort.;
Okami Review;9;Superb; Okami's visual design instantly stands out, but it turns out to be just one of many inspired aspects of this impressive action adventure game.;
Spy Hunter: Nowhere to Run Review;5.5;Mediocre; It gets points for its unrelenting pace, but the action in Spy Hunter: Nowhere to Run is too derivative and mechanical to matter.;
Spy Hunter: Nowhere to Run Review;5.5;Mediocre; It gets points for its unrelenting pace, but the action in Spy Hunter: Nowhere to Run is too derivative and mechanical to matter.;
Bomberman Review;7.5;Good; This game brings Bomberman to the PSP with plenty of enjoyable, challenging single-player levels, as well as the fun and frantic multiplayer battles the series is known for.;
The Godfather: Mob Wars Review;6;Fair; Mob Wars is actually two different games, both of which fail to realize their respective potential.;
The King of Fighters 2006 Review;7.3;Good; The next fully 3D installment in SNK's long-running fighting game series is a lot better than the first and features a surprising number of interesting characters to play around with.;
ProStroke Golf - World Tour 2007 Review;5;Mediocre; ProStroke Golf - World Tour 2007 is a deeply flawed game that fails to bring anything new to the world of golf games.;
NHL 07 Review;7.2;Good; EA makes its PSP NHL debut in NHL 07, a serviceable game of hockey that has its good qualities but also feels unpolished.;
Bounty Hounds Review;6.9;Fair; Bounty Hounds has a unique visual style and some appealing gameplay concepts, but the core action is too repetitive and shallow to sustain your interest for very long.;
LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy Review;7.3;Good; Despite a litany of glitches, LEGO Star Wars II is a rousing action adventure game that lives up to its source material.;
NHL 07 Review;7.1;Good; Perhaps unsurprisingly, the versions of NHL 07 not made for the next generation of consoles offer little in the way of new content.;

NHL 07 Review;7.1;Good; Perhaps unsurprisingly, the versions of NHL 07 not made for the next generation of consoles offer little in the way of new content.;

American McGee Presents Bad Day LA Review;3;Bad; Bad Day LA is an abject failure.;
NHL 2K7 Review;8.3;Great; The outstanding gameplay mechanics will be familiar to fans of the series, but NHL 2K7 makes important strides in the realm of presentation with this year's 360 offering.;
Company of Heroes Review;9;Superb; While intimidating, this visceral real-time strategy reenactment of World War II's Western Front showcases just how far RTS game design and presentation quality have come.;
Lego Star Wars II Review;7.7;Good; The gameplay hasn't changed dramatically, but better source material makes Lego Star Wars II a better game than its predecessor.;

Disgaea 2: Cursed Memories Review;8.2;Great; Just like the first Disgaea, this strategy role-playing game is best suited for fans of other stuff like it, and it's chock-full of depth, lasting value, and surprisingly good humor.;
Dance Factory Review;4.3;Poor; Dance Factory's main feature is the ability to generate dance steps to your own music CDs. There's just one problem: It doesn't really work.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.

Yakuza Review;7.4;Good; Yakuza vividly portrays modern Japan and its organized crime families, but it pulls its punches before delivering a truly great action game or a completely satisfying story.;
Lego Star Wars II Review;7.7;Good; The gameplay hasn't changed dramatically, but better source material makes Lego Star Wars II a better game than its predecessor.;
Perimeter: Emperor's Testament Review;7.3;Good; Emperor's Testament offers plenty of new missions to keep you busy, although the overall experience is practically identical to that of its predecessor.;
Guilty Gear Judgment Review;7.5;Good; The over-the-top anime stylings of the Guilty Gear series deliver a one-two punch in this package containing both a beat-'em-up and a fighting game.;

50 Cent: Bulletproof Review;5.1;Mediocre; Turning 50 Cent: Bulletproof from a third-person shooter into a top-down shooter does make G Unit Edition feel new, but it doesn't make it fun.;
Saints Row Review;8.3;Great; Saints Row may look like just another Grand Theft Auto rip-off, but the rare quality of its action and presentation make it stand tall on its own merits.;
Time Pilot Review;7;Good; Time Pilot might not be as well known as some of the other Xbox Live Arcade classics, but it's still a quality shooter with nicely updated graphics and sound.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Ultimate Ghosts 'n Goblins Review;6.7;Fair; Ultimate Ghosts 'n Goblins is a great-looking update of a classic platformer, but it can be frustratingly difficult to a fault.;

Madden NFL 07 Review;6.5;Fair; To make a long story short, Madden NFL 07 for the GBA is simply the 06 game with updated rosters and five extra minigames.;
Enchanted Arms Review;7.1;Good; Enchanted Arms is a capable and often enjoyable role-playing game, but it's also one that you'll likely forget as soon as you finish it.;
Star Fox Command Review;7.5;Good; The Star Fox fighter squadron returns in this solid flight combat game, which distinguishes itself with its strategic elements and well-designed touch-screen controls.;
Def Jam: Fight for NY: The Takeover Review;8;Great; The newest Def Jam fighter may be an update of a nearly two-year-old game, but this PSP brawler still packs a punch.;
Sword of the Stars Review;7.4;Good; Despite some flaws with the combat, Sword of the Stars distills the complex space strategy formula to a slick, streamlined, and enjoyable package.;
Madden NFL 07 Review;7.6;Good; Madden NFL 07 cleans up some of the issues of its PSP predecessor, but then it tosses in a small pile of new problems to contend with.;
D1 Grand Prix Review;4.3;Poor; Drift racing is supposed to be fast-paced and exciting and it's neither of those things in D1 Grand Prix, a lifeless and frustrating PS2 racing game.;
Safecracker: The Ultimate Puzzle Adventure Review;6.5;Fair; As long as you're not too hung up on variety and plot, these breaking-and-entering brainteasers will delight puzzle fans.;
Madden NFL 07 Review;8.1;Great; It's hard not to look at the current generation version of Madden as an aging veteran on its last legs, but that veteran still has a bit of game left ...;
Texas Hold 'Em Review;6.1;Fair; Texas Hold 'em does the barest of bare minimums to make a playable game of Xbox Live Arcade poker.;

Tenchu: Dark Secret Review;4.3;Poor; You'd be better off staying away from this botched attempt to translate the great ninja stealth action series to the DS. Almost nothing good about Tenchu made the cut.;

Madden NFL 07 Review;7.7;Good; Madden NFL 07 overcomes its no-frills presentation by providing all of the play modes and rich football fundamentals that fans have come to expect.;

Deep Labyrinth Review;6.3;Fair; This 3D role-playing game lets you explore many mazelike levels through the eyes of a sword-wielding hero, but crawling through its corridors often isn't much fun.;

Xyanide Review;7.2;Good; Though Xyanide plays similarly to various classic arcade shoot-'em-ups, it's got its own strange twists and style that are worth experiencing by fans of similar games.;
Payout Poker & Casino Review;6.1;Fair; The casino games in Payout are mostly competent, but the game spreads itself too thin and delivers almost none of the promised real-world casino atmosphere.;
Madden NFL 07 Review;8.1;Great; It's hard not to look at the current generation version of Madden as an aging veteran on its last legs, but that veteran still has a bit of game left ...;

Super Monkey Ball Adventure Review;5.7;Mediocre; Traveller's Tales has perverted Sega's previously charming action puzzle series into a clumsy, frustrating action adventure game.;
Barnyard Review;5.9;Mediocre; Some of the minigames are fun, and the story is charming, but it's tough to recommend a game that's absolutely done in less than three hours.;
Barnyard Review;7.1;Good; The open-ended design is a breath of fresh air, while the overall presentation lives up to the movie's skewed style and humor.;
Barnyard Review;7.1;Good; The open-ended design is a breath of fresh air, while the overall presentation lives up to the movie's skewed style and humor.;
Super Monkey Ball Adventure Review;5.7;Mediocre; Traveller's Tales has perverted Sega's previously charming action puzzle series into a clumsy, frustrating action adventure game.;
Sprint Cars: Road to Knoxville Review;5.8;Mediocre; A decent fit for sprint car enthusiasts, Road to Knoxville is too stripped-down and too single-minded for anyone else.;

FlatOut 2 Review;7.4;Good; FlatOut 2 seems a little too slick for its own good in spots, but it still manages to provide plenty of destructive racing fun.;
FlatOut 2 Review;7.4;Good; FlatOut 2 seems a little too slick for its own good in spots, but it still manages to provide plenty of destructive racing fun.;

Dungeon Siege II: Broken World Review;6.3;Fair; Broken World brings a couple of welcome new features to an already good game, but the short campaign and lack of compelling content will leave you feeling disappointed.;

The Ant Bully Review;4.3;Poor; This 3D adventure game does expand on the movie's story, but it's also uninteresting and repetitive.;
Warpath Review;5.7;Mediocre; As a cheaply priced, multiplayer-focused first-person shooter, Warpath is serviceable, if utterly unremarkable.;
Painkiller: Hell Wars Review;7.9;Good; A hodgepodge of memorable levels and satisfyingly straightforward and bloody pure shooting action highlights this first-person shooter, which combines the PC version of Painkiller with its expansion pack.;
The Ant Bully Review;4.3;Poor; This 3D adventure game does expand on the movie's story, but it's also uninteresting and repetitive.;
Summon Night: Swordcraft Story Review;7.4;Good; It's a basic dungeon crawler at heart, but Summon Night: Swordcraft Story has enough fun with the formula to make it worth playing for role-playing fans.;
CivCity: Rome Review;6.6;Fair; CivCity: Rome could have been a classic, but it wound up just another city builder.;
The Secrets of Da Vinci: The Forbidden Manuscript Review;6.5;Fair; It's generic to a fault, but The Secrets of Da Vinci still delivers a fairly enjoyable experience for fans of adventure games.;
The Ant Bully Review;6.2;Fair; This simple adventure game should be just right for younger players and anyone that wants an inoffensive game based on their favorite movie.;

The Ant Bully Review;4.3;Poor; This 3D adventure game does expand on the movie's story, but it's also uninteresting and repetitive.;
Warpath Review;5.7;Mediocre; As a cheaply priced, multiplayer-focused first-person shooter, Warpath is serviceable, if utterly unremarkable.;
Monster House Review;4.7;Poor; Excellent atmosphere notwithstanding, this third-person action game is hobbled by tedious combat and a number of dubious design problems.;
Outlaw Chopper Review;2.4;Terrible; This god-awful Grand Theft Auto clone looks, sounds, and plays like it cost even less to make than it will cost you to buy it.;
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest Review;6.7;Fair; Intriguing nautical elements aren't enough to distract from a criminally short running time and rote 2D platforming elements.;
Monster House Review;4.7;Poor; Excellent atmosphere notwithstanding, this third-person action game is hobbled by tedious combat and a number of dubious design problems.;
Monster House Review;8.2;Great; This fast-paced role-playing game is faithful to the movie and is also downright fun.;

Blade Dancer: Lineage of Light Review;6.8;Fair; Blade Dancer plays by the book as far as the narrative goes, but an interesting crafting mechanic and an adaptive battle system with real-time elements help set it apart.;

Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest Review;5.9;Mediocre; Though Dead Man's Chest is largely competent, the sword fighting is too repetitive and the minigames are too few and too bland to get anyone particularly excited.;
The Ship Review;8.3;Great; This wildly different take on Quake, The Sims, and Clue is off the wall and innovative.;
NCAA Football 07 Review;8.8;Great; EA Sports' NCAA Football series continues to mature and evolve, and NCAA Football 07 is its best entry yet.;
Civilization IV: Warlords Review;8.6;Great; Warlords adds six new civilizations and other enhancements to Civilization IV, but the cool new scenarios are the real treat in this expansion.;
Super Dragon Ball Z Review;7.3;Good; Super Dragon Ball Z packs in some simple, traditional fighting game action with a decent amount of style.;
NCAA Football 07 Review;8.2;Great; With compelling gameplay and college atmosphere for miles, NCAA Football 07 is a fine debut on the Xbox 360.;
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest Review;6.6;Fair; The spirit of the source material is there in the presentation, and the multiplayer is a pleasant surprise, but the single-player experience is too stiflingly repetitive to ignore.;

IHRA Drag Racing: Sportsman Edition Review;3.4;Bad; This game sucks all the fun out of drag racing, presenting the sport as slow and tedious instead of fast and furious.;
Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth Review;7.5;Good; Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth is a solid port of a one-of-a-kind role-playing game that is endlessly appealing to genre fans who are looking for something different, but it's a bit too ...;
NCAA Football 07 Review;7.6;Good; NCAA Football 07 doesn't have the bells and whistles of the console game;
MTX Mototrax Review;7.6;Good; MTX Mototrax offers a respectable challenge and fun, satisfying racing in one relatively cheap package.;
Chromehounds Review;7.9;Good; This unique mech combat sim looks great in action, but gets most of its mileage out of its persistent online campaign, which can be very fun for dedicated players.;
Cossacks II: Battle for Europe Review;6.9;Fair; This stand-alone expansion to last year's Napoleonic Wars doesn't add a lot that is noteworthy.;
Juiced Eliminator Review;6;Fair; Juiced wasn't an impressive street racer a year ago when it was released on consoles, so it is perhaps only logical that a year later, the game is just as ...;
Ruff Trigger: Vanocore Conspiracy Review;6.2;Fair; Ruff Trigger's budget price is just about its only saving grace, because any neat mechanic in the game is met on all ends by the boring and sometimes frustrating gameplay.;
Moscow to Berlin: Red Siege Review;4.6;Poor; There's no shortage of World War II strategy games on the market, and Moscow to Berlin does nothing good to stand out from the pack.;
Micro Machines V4 Review;5.8;Mediocre; The novelty of racing teeny tiny cars is more than a little bit stale, and so is Micro Machines v4.;

Micro Machines V4 Review;5.5;Mediocre; The novelty of racing teeny, tiny cars is more than a little bit stale, and so is Micro Machines v4.;

The Lord of the Rings The Battle for Middle-earth II Review;8.3;Great; The Battle for Middle-earth II proves that real-time strategy works on the Xbox 360. It's also a pretty impressive game, as well.;
Night Watch Review;5.4;Mediocre; Night Watch is a stripped-down turn-based strategy game that starts off interesting, but eventually settles into a shallow and repetitive rut.;
Sudoku Gridmaster Review;6.2;Fair; Sudoku Gridmaster's interface is lacking, making this a second-rate puzzle collection, at best.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Break 'Em All Review;6.3;Fair; This budget-priced Arkanoid clone has its moments of creativity, but mostly it's just a serviceable puzzler that offers little outside of well-worn territory.;
Crusty Demons Review;4.6;Poor; As an idea, Crusty Demons isn't so bad. As a game, it's weighed down by frustrating controls and lackluster presentation.;
Titan Quest Review;7.6;Good; With its lengthy single-player campaign, well-integrated multiplayer, and full-featured level editor, Titan Quest is a robust package that nonetheless feels all too familiar.;
World Tour Soccer 2 Review;7.4;Good; World Tour Soccer returns for a second season, with the same skill-based reward system but new wireless Internet play.;
Micro Machines V4 Review;5.3;Mediocre; The novelty of racing teeny, tiny cars is more than a little bit stale, and so is Micro Machines V4.;
Tomb Raider: Legend Review;6.2;Fair; If you can get past the poor controls and irritating camera, Tomb Raider: Legend on the PSP offers the same fairly enjoyable experience as its PC and console counterparts.;
Soldier Elite Review;4.6;Poor; Soldier Elite wants very badly to be a stealth action game, but it lacks any understanding of the subtlety and nuance that are essential to the genre.;
NFL Head Coach Review;7.2;Good; Its laborious pacing and artificial-intelligence issues not withstanding, NFL Head Coach is a worthwhile first attempt at a football-management simulation.;
Mega Man Battle Network 6: Cybeast Gregar Review;6.9;Fair; The story may justify the price of admission, but there's really nothing new in Mega Man Battle Network 6 that wasn't in previous games.;

Mega Man Battle Network 6 Cybeast Falzar Review;6.9;Fair; The story may justify the price of admission, but there's really nothing new in Mega Man Battle Network 6 that wasn't in previous games.;

Cars Review;7.4;Good; It may be yet another racing title for the PSP, but this Pixar-movie-licensed game is probably one of the better options available for younger kids.;
Cars Review;6.5;Fair; All of the various minigames are fun, but there aren't enough of them here to hold a person's attention for more than a couple hours.;
Rise & Fall: Civilizations at War Review;6.6;Fair; Rise & Fall combines real-time strategy with third-person action, and while it's an interesting idea, ultimately this game doesn't quite know what it wants to be.;

Teen Titans Review;6.6;Fair; Teen Titans the game makes good use of the license to spice up what is otherwise a very average beat-'em-up.;
Gradius Collection Review;8.2;Great; More than a decade's worth of games from Konami's classic space shoot-'em-up series is contained in this great collection, which offers plenty of intense action, not just nostalgia.;
Astonishia Story Review;6;Fair; Astonishia Story lacks the depth and character to be anything more than a mere skeleton of a good role-playing game.;

X-Men: The Official Game Review;6.6;Fair; X-Men: The Official Game for the GBA is a by-the-book side-scroller.;

The Da Vinci Code Review;6.5;Fair; The Da Vinci Code is a middling adventure game take on Dan Brown's mega-selling novel, but it does do at least a few things reasonably well.;
2006 FIFA World Cup Review;8.1;Great; 2006 FIFA World Cup does a good job of re-creating the carnival atmosphere that surrounds the competition, and it plays a good, fast-paced game of soccer to boot.;

OutRun 2006: Coast 2 Coast Review;8;Great; OutRun 2006: Coast 2 Coast offers a fun, accessible experience to racing fans who just want to jam on the accelerator and go.;

Buzz!: The BIG Quiz Review;6.2;Fair; The BIG Quiz's pick-up-and-play qualities make it an addictive endeavour, but the abundance of base-level questions and some irritating quirks ultimately drag it down.;
Atelier Iris 2: The Azoth of Destiny Review;7;Good; Atelier Iris 2 carries the same great style and humor of its predecessor, but the tedious quest design spoils some of the fun.;
Ace Combat Zero: The Belkan War Review;7.9;Good; Ace Combat Zero may not do anything particularly different or better than its predecessors, but it still delivers some excellent dogfighting and a good story tying it all together.;
World War II Combat: Road to Berlin Review;2;Terrible; If America's participation in World War II was as frustratingly terrible as this game, all of Europe would be speaking German today.;
Blazing Angels: Squadrons of WWII Review;6.9;Fair; Blazing Angels has a decent campaign and a fair amount of online options, but its standard gameplay and a lack of online competition prevent it from being very exciting.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.

Tycoon City New York Review;6.7;Fair; Tycoon City New York does a decent job at unleashing your inner Donald Trump with an attractive, albeit easy, city simulation.;
Super Black Bass Fishing Review;5.3;Mediocre; Apart from the stylus-based reel controls, there's nothing particularly good or interesting about Super Black Bass Fishing.;
Classified: The Sentinel Crisis Review;5.4;Mediocre; The Sentinel Crisis would merely be a slightly below-average console first-person shooter if it weren't so short on content and terribly boring.;
Rampage: Total Destruction Review;5.7;Mediocre; Total Destruction is a glossy coat of paint on an ancient gameplay formula that simply doesn't hold water in 2006.;

Keepsake Review;5.2;Mediocre; It's got some occasionally interesting puzzles, but the lame story and irritating characters kill whatever appeal Keepsake might have had.;
Monster Rancher EVO Review;6.4;Fair; Along the way to becoming a more traditional RPG, EVO loses much of the Monster Rancher appeal.;
Major League Baseball 2K6 Review;6.8;Fair; The apathetic presentation and a slew of gameplay bugs make it hard to enjoy Major League Baseball 2K6, which is otherwise a deep and feature-rich baseball simulation.;
Warship Gunner 2 Review;6.7;Fair; If you can get past its dense and uninviting interface, Warship Gunner 2 offers unique naval combat and an incredible amount of ship customization.;
Tomb Raider: Legend Review;7.8;Good; Tomb Raider: Legend is a brief but fun adventure that just about anyone can enjoy.;
Major League Baseball 2K6 Review;7.4;Good; Major League Baseball 2K6 is a deep and feature-rich baseball simulation, but its portrayal of the sport is apathetic.;

Dreamfall: The Longest Journey Review;8.1;Great; Anchored by a wonderful cast of characters, the very well-crafted sci-fi story in Dreamfall will leave you anxiously wanting more.;
Dreamfall: The Longest Journey Review;8.1;Great; Anchored by a wonderful cast of characters, the very well-crafted sci-fi story in Dreamfall will leave you anxiously wanting more.;

Monster 4x4: World Circuit Review;4.7;Poor; Monster 4x4: World Circuit manages to make the act of driving comically gigantic trucks through destructible environments a complete and utter bore.;
UberSoldier Review;4.6;Poor; Massive system requirements, a by-the-numbers campaign, and no multiplayer make for a first-person shooter that doesn't have much in the way of redeeming qualities.;
Condemned: Criminal Origins Review;8.1;Great; This first-person action game hits you like a sledgehammer with its astounding, stunningly creepy presentation, but it sacrifices opportunities for more shocks and surprises by settling for repetition.;
Battlefield 2: Modern Combat Review;7.5;Good; Underneath its shiny new coat of paint, Modern Combat for the Xbox 360 is still basically the same, solid team-based shooter that was released last year on the Xbox and ...;
Top Spin 2 Review;2.9;Terrible; Top Spin 2 for the DS offers a good player roster and a deep shot system, but the choppy graphics render the game unplayable.;
Samurai Champloo: Sidetracked Review;7.6;Good; The gameplay can get rather tiresome after a while, but Samurai Champloo's goofy sense of humor and stylish touches make it more than just your average button-masher.;
The Tower SP Review;5.3;Mediocre; There's plenty to do early on while playing The Tower SP, but after three hours or so, you can literally watch it play itself.;
Onimusha 3: Demon Siege Review;7.4;Good; Blatantly ripped straight from the PlayStation 2, this version of Onimusha 3 still packs some good, solid hack-and-slash combat and a likable story.;
Odama Review;6.6;Fair; It's definitely unique as far as strategy games go, but Odama's novel mechanics and oddly authentic samurai feel are kneecapped by punishing difficulty and oft frustrating controls.;
The King of Fighters NeoWave Review;6.5;Fair; This updated version of King of Fighters 2002 is mainly suited for fans of the 2D fighting series looking to settle their differences online.;
Tomb Raider: Legend Review;7.8;Good; Tomb Raider: Legend is a brief but fun adventure that just about anyone can enjoy.;
CSI: 3 Dimensions of Murder Review;6;Fair; Despite the touted inclusion of full 3D environments and longer cases, 3 Dimensions of Murder mostly covers well-worn territory, and it's still a breeze to play through.;

Tomb Raider: Legend Review;7.8;Good; Tomb Raider: Legend is a brief but fun adventure that just about anyone can enjoy.;

Untold Legends: The Warrior's Code Review;6.9;Fair; It's a better hack-and-slash experience than Brotherhood of the Blade, but The Warrior's Code is still only suitable for dedicated fans of hack-and-slash dungeon crawlers.;
Far Cry Instincts Predator Review;7.9;Good; By packaging last year's excellent Far Cry Instincts with a new campaign and a bigger multiplayer suite, Far Cry Instincts Predator delivers a ton of content to Xbox 360 owners.;
NBA Ballers: Phenom Review;7.5;Good; Phenom brings back a lot of the same blacktop-hoops flavor that made the original Ballers so much fun and adds free-roaming action to its story mode.;
From Russia With Love Review;6.3;Fair; From Russia With Love is no less simplistic a shooter on the PSP than it was on consoles, and new problems conspire to make this version markedly worse.;
Go! Sudoku Review;6.6;Fair; Go! Sudoku is a competent package, but due to the pervasive nature of Sudoku these days, you probably don't need to spend any money to get puzzles like this.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Tourist Trophy Review;8.2;Great; Tourist Trophy covers familiar territory, but also manages to craft a unique and authentic motorcycle racing experience.;
NBA Ballers: Phenom Review;7.2;Good; Phenom brings back a lot of the same blacktop-hoops flavor that made the original Ballers so much fun, and adds free-roaming action to its story mode.;

True Crime: New York City Review;5.2;Mediocre; Even if you forgive the flimsy story and derivative gameplay, you'll have a hard time getting past the frustrating technical problems that plague this game.;
Ice Age 2 Review;7.3;Good; A kid-friendly platformer with more heart than your average film-to-game marketing tie-in, Ice Age 2 can be quite fun--for as long as it lasts.;
Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter Review;4.4;Poor; It may share the same name as the excellent Xbox 360 shooter, but the quality of the experience has been severely compromised in translation to the PS2.;

Beatmania Review;5.6;Mediocre; Beatmania's long-overdue release outside of Japan shows off its many weaknesses, with the most egregious of which being its unimpressive song list.;
Top Spin 2 Review;8.2;Great; Top Spin 2 has no ambition to redefine how tennis games are played. It just delivers a responsive and well-rounded tennis game that shouldn't be missed by fans.;

Splinter Cell Essentials Review;5.8;Mediocre; Splinter Cell Essentials keeps the stealthy spirit intact on the PSP, but some costly sacrifices have been made to get it there.;
Neopets Petpet Adventures: The Wand of Wishing Review;6.5;Fair; Its cute and fluffy appearance is deceiving, as The Wand of Wishing turns out to be less accessible than the action RPGs it is derived from.;

Pac-Man World 3 Review;6.9;Fair; Pac-Man World 3 is a platformer, characterized most notably by its fusion of classic Pac-Man moments and generic platforming gameplay.;
Need for Speed Most Wanted Review;6.2;Fair; Need for Speed Most Wanted is a competent racing game, even if it is missing much of what made the console versions interesting.;
Hardwood Backgammon Review;6.8;Fair; It's functional backgammon on your 360, and not much else. But if you're into the game, that's probably good enough.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Ford Racing 3 Review;4.6;Poor; Ford Racing 3 is a dull and clumsy racing game that will disappoint even the most forgiving Ford enthusiasts.;
PQ: Practical Intelligence Quotient Review;7;Good; It's highly dubious as a measurable test of your logical mind, but PQ can still be a fun, challenging puzzle game.;
Need for Speed Most Wanted Review;5.3;Mediocre; This watered-down imitation of the console game has some glaring problems.;
G-Unit: Free Yayo Review;5.4;Mediocre; The members of G-Unit come off as incidental in this shooting gallery-style game, which offers some nice cartoon graphics but not much in the way of exciting action.;
ATV: Quad Frenzy Review;3.6;Bad; ATV Quad Fury's lackluster tempo and ugly user interface makes it one to avoid on the Nintendo DS.;
Space Hack Review;5.8;Mediocre; Space Hack mimics the hack-and-slash formula common to all action RPGs, but its budget price and sheer length don't make up for its dull pace and bland combat.;
Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones Review;7.3;Good; This side-scrolling action game lets you play as both an acrobatic prince as well as his darker side through a short series of entertaining and varied levels.;
Crime Life: Gang Wars Review;2.1;Terrible; Crime Life is just plain awful. Do yourself a favor and stay away from it.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Mega Man X Collection Review;7.2;Good; Mega Man X Collection follows the same basic formula as Capcom's excellent first Mega Man compilation, but it just doesn't have quite as much to offer.;
Mega Man X Collection Review;7.2;Good; Mega Man X Collection follows the same basic formula as Capcom's excellent first Mega Man compilation, but it just doesn't have quite as much to offer.;
Universal Combat: A World Apart Review;3;Bad; This stand-alone expansion to 2004's Universal Combat adds a few new features, but it can't make up for dated production values and some dubious gameplay.;
Dragon Booster Review;2.9;Terrible; Dragon Booster is a halfhearted and practically unplayable racing game with no redeeming qualities.;
Wild Arms 4 Review;7.8;Good; Wild Arms 4 is largely a standard by-the-book role-playing game, but the unique battle system and other touches still make it a worthy journey.;
Peter Jackson's King Kong: The Official Game of the Movie Review;6.2;Fair; It is most definitely King Kong in the palm of your hand, but the sacrifices and compromises made to get it there ultimately suck away much of its appeal.;
Ultimate Block Party Review;7.9;Good; Ultimate Block Party is easy to pick up and play, and once you do, the quick, chaotic puzzle battles will have you hooked.;
Legion Arena Review;6.9;Fair; This tactical combat game features battles, battles, and more battles, and it's fun, though very light on content or depth.;
Law & Order: Criminal Intent Review;5;Mediocre; Criminal Intent dares to try a few new things with the established Law & Order formula, but none of them are done very well.;
Hammer & Sickle Review;3.6;Bad; The KGB wasn't as hard on political dissidents as Hammer & Sickle is on those who play it.;
Real Time Conflict: Shogun Empires Review;3.3;Bad; You'd think that a real-time strategy game would be a great fit for the Nintendo DS, but stay away from this one and its busted artificial intelligence and half-baked minigames.;
UFO: Aftershock Review;4;Poor; UFO: Aftershock improves on its predecessor in some ways, but there's just far too much wrong with this copy of the classic X-COM series to recommend it.;
Elf Bowling 1 & 2 Review;1.4;Abysmal; Both games are completely devoid of gameplay, fun, and flair. Worse, they are available free for the PC.;
Electroplankton Review;7.3;Good; Electroplankton is an interesting experiment in both music and game design, but its reliance on the novelty of something different limits its lasting value.;
Elf Bowling 1 & 2 Review;1.4;Abysmal; Both games are completely devoid of gameplay, fun, and flair. Worse, they are available free for the PC.;
Zatch Bell! Mamodo Battles Review;5;Mediocre; This undemanding fighter may be good enough for anime fans, but the game is too simple for fighting fans and too self-referential for anyone else.;
Chaos Field Review;6.2;Fair; This shoot-'em-up tries to follow in the footsteps of games like Ikaruga and Raiden, putting its own interesting-but-flawed spin on some aspects of the formula.;
Spyro: Shadow Legacy Review;5.3;Mediocre; Spyro: Shadow Legacy is a watered-down action role-playing game that isn't challenging or engaging enough to sustain its brief campaign.;
Battles of Prince of Persia Review;7.4;Good; Underneath its modest looks and intimidating, complex battle system is a turn-based strategy game that is surprisingly fun and satisfying.;
The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe Review;6.3;Fair; The storybook charm of Narnia quickly fades away, leaving a fairly average game that doesn't do much to complement the movie.;
Dead or Alive 4 Review;8.8;Great; Tecmo's long-running fighting game series hits the Xbox 360 with its best installment to date, complete with plenty of complex and interesting characters, outstandingly good visuals, and great online play.;
Armored Core: Formula Front Review;7.5;Good; Simulation fans will enjoy Formula Front's extremely in-depth mech-customization system, but the steep learning curve and lack of any real action will probably turn off everyone else.;
Wik: The Fable of Souls Review;7.5;Good; The main character of this cleverly designed game gets to swing around using his tongue and inhale grubs and other bugs, but it's a whole lot more pleasant than that.;
Combat Elite: WWII Paratroopers Review;5.4;Mediocre; A third-person, World War II action RPG is an interesting concept, but the execution in Combat Elite leaves a lot to be desired.;
Robotron: 2084 Review;7.4;Good; Like the other classic arcade games on Xbox Live Arcade, Robotron: 2084 remains true to its arcade roots while including great additions like online scoreboards and multiplayer.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe Review;6.2;Fair; With so many better action adventure games available on the Game Boy Advance, this short, simplistic game is especially difficult to recommend, even for fans of the movie.;
Outpost Kaloki X Review;7.1;Good; Outpost Kaloki X lets you try your hand at running an intergalactic shopping mall in what's a pretty well-designed, fast-paced little 3D tycoon-style strategy game.;
Midway Arcade Treasures: Extended Play Review;5.2;Mediocre; There's a lot of potential here, but many of the games have issues with their graphics, sound, or control that make the entire package a real disappointment.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Combat Elite: WWII Paratroopers Review;5.4;Mediocre; A third-person, World War II action RPG is an interesting concept, but the execution in Combat Elite leaves a lot to be desired.;
Driver: Vegas Review;3.9;Bad; Driver: Vegas is vaguely reminiscent of the old-school Grand Theft Auto look and feel, but it fails miserably in almost every aspect of its execution.;
Prince of Persia Revelations Review;7.4;Good; Sound bugs and loading times mar an otherwise great translation of Warrior Within to a portable platform.;
Mario Tennis: Power Tour Review;8.5;Great; Once again, Nintendo has taken a sport that not everyone likes and has transformed it into a fun-filled game that's suitable for any player of any age.;
King Kong: The Official Game of the Movie Review;7.1;Good; Two playable characters, including the gigantic gorilla himself, highlight this well-crafted but short and fairly easy side-scrolling action adventure game, which fans of the movie should enjoy.;
WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW 2006 Review;8.5;Great; The first wrestler on the PSP is a worthy port of the acclaimed PlayStation 2 game, but its value is somewhat dubious to those who already own the original.;
World Championship Poker 2: Featuring Howard Lederer Review;7.5;Good; World Championship Poker 2's offline play is the best you'll find amid this year's competition, and the online play is still pretty engaging.;
World Championship Poker 2: Featuring Howard Lederer Review;7.5;Good; World Championship Poker 2's offline play is the best you'll find amid this year's competition, and the online play is still pretty engaging.;
Shrek SuperSlam Review;6.5;Fair; Shrek SuperSlam is a decent attempt at a 3D brawler on the Nintendo DS, but the gameplay quickly wears thin, leaving you with nothing more than a somewhat dated license.;
World Championship Poker 2: Featuring Howard Lederer Review;7.5;Good; World Championship Poker 2's offline play is the best you'll find amid this year's competition, and the online play is still pretty engaging.;
Pinball Hall of Fame: The Gottlieb Collection Review;7.1;Good; Pinball Hall of Fame delivers some accurate re-creations of some of Gottlieb's classic pinball tables, but the graphics get a little muddy in spots.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Gauntlet: Seven Sorrows Review;5.2;Mediocre; Whether you play it alone or with friends, this uninspired update to the '80s swords-and-sorcery arcade dungeon crawl misses the mark with its boring, mindless action and short, forgettable quest.;
Ridge Racer Review;6.1;Fair; It looks like a Ridge Racer game, but the limited control and poor sense of speed get in the way of making it feel like a Ridge Racer game.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Dr. Mario / Puzzle League Review;8;Great; Despite the bare presentation, this cartridge is a must-have for fans of puzzle games.;
America's Army: Rise of a Soldier Review;7.6;Good; Rise of a Soldier's interesting, RPG-like character building feature is one of the highlights of a solid all-around shooter.;
Final Fantasy IV Advance Review;8.3;Great; Final Fantasy IV, arguably the breakthrough entry in the influential series, is a perfect fit for the Game Boy Advance and is a must-play experience for fans of role-playing games.;
PoPoLoCrois Review;7.3;Good; Popolocrois is a charming adventure for casual fans of role-playing games, but its simplicity negates any lasting appeal it may have had.;
World Championship Poker 2: Featuring Howard Lederer Review;7.5;Good; World Championship Poker 2's offline play is the best you'll find amid this year's competition, and the online play is still pretty engaging.;
Blitzkrieg 2 Review;7.8;Good; Though by no means difficult or historically accurate, Blitzkrieg 2 is still a fun, fast-paced World War II strategy game that lets you steamroll opponents into the ground.;
One Review;6.6;Fair; One is a fairly ambitious portable fighting game that looks impressive on the N-Gage, but lacks the sort of deep, hard-hitting action you'd probably expect.;
The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe Review;6.9;Fair; This console and PC trip through the Wardrobe is a mostly run-of-the-mill action adventure that might hold some measure of appeal to fans of the film, but not so much ...;
Zuma Deluxe Review;7.2;Good; Realize your dreams of becoming a multicolored-ball-spitting stone frog in Zuma Deluxe, a simple but fun Xbox Live Arcade action puzzle game that's like a cross between billiards and Bust-a-Move.;
Diplomacy Review;5.1;Mediocre; The latest attempt to translate the famous board game gets mired in some dubious design decisions and bad AI.;
Land of the Dead: Road to Fiddler's Green Review;1.9;Abysmal; This game fails to deliver even the most garden-variety zombie-killing thrills, due to its inept combat, bad visuals, and cripplingly stupid artificial intelligence.;
Crime Life: Gang Wars Review;2.1;Terrible; Crime Life: Gang Wars is just plain awful. Do yourself a favor and stay away from it.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe Review;6.9;Fair; This console and PC trip through the Wardrobe is a mostly run-of-the-mill action adventure that might hold some measure of appeal to fans of the film, but not so much ...;
The Sims 2 Review;6.1;Fair; The Sims 2 for the PSP has some genuinely good concepts, but they're buried under the game's issues, both minor and major.;
The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe Review;6.9;Fair; This console and PC trip through the Wardrobe is a mostly run-of-the-mill action adventure that might hold some measure of appeal to fans of the film, but not so much ...;

Dragon Ball Z: Supersonic Warriors 2 Review;6.9;Fair; Though still providing some fun, fast-paced fighting action, Supersonic Warriors 2 lacks some of the care of its predecessor and feels like a somewhat slapdash GBA-to-DS conversion.;
Gauntlet: Seven Sorrows Review;5.2;Mediocre; Whether you play it alone or with friends, this uninspired update to the '80s swords-and-sorcery arcade dungeon crawl misses the mark with its boring, mindless action and short, forgettable quest.;
Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones Review;8.4;Great; The Two Thrones provides a satisfying conclusion to the Sands of Time trilogy, with a lot of the same puzzle-solving and gorgeous environments you remembered from the previous two games.;
Operation Flashpoint: Elite Review;5.4;Mediocre; It provides an interesting look back at the history of vehicle-based first-person shooters, but as a modern Xbox game, Operation Flashpoint: Elite doesn't hold up.;
Bankshot Billiards 2 Review;4.2;Poor; Bankshot Billiards 2 doesn't play a great game of pool, and as the most expensive Xbox Live Arcade game available, it represents lousy value for the money.;
Animal Crossing: Wild World Review;8.4;Great; Wild World doesn't toy with the original Animal Crossing formula, but simply being able to take your town with you on the go makes it an easy recommendation.;
Super Mario Strikers Review;7.2;Good;" It's soccer starring Mario and friends, but the problem is, there just isn't enough ""Mario"" in Super Mario Strikers.";
Burnout Legends Review;4;Poor; Just because Burnout Legends has the name on the box does not rightfully make it a Burnout game, and this decrepit DS racer is most definitely not Burnout.;
Tokobot Review;8.2;Great; Tokobot is a charming and entertaining platformer, and its only major setback is that there isn't more of it to go around.;
Wallace & Gromit: Curse of the Were-Rabbit Review;6.3;Fair; The cute claymation couple look and sound pretty good in this mission-based platformer, but the gameplay isn't all that compelling.;
Shrek SuperSlam Review;6.9;Fair; Shrek SuperSlam is an easy game to pick up and play, but unless you're a big fan of the license there isn't much to keep you playing.;
Wallace & Gromit: Curse of the Were-Rabbit Review;6.3;Fair; The cute claymation couple look and sound pretty good in this mission-based platformer, but the gameplay isn't all that compelling.;
Greg Hastings' Tournament Paintball Max'd Review;7.1;Good; Greg Hastings' Tournament Paintball Max'd captures the intensity and excitement of paintball, and in the end it's only limited by the confines of the sport itself.;
Peter Jackson's King Kong: The Official Game of the Movie Review;2.8;Terrible; Kong's DS adventure is unambitious, boring, ugly, and buggy.;
Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones Review;8.6;Great; The Two Thrones provides a satisfying conclusion to the Sands of Time trilogy, with a lot of the same puzzle solving and gorgeous environments you remembered from the previous two ...;
Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 3: Night of the Quinkan Review;6.9;Fair; All of the different weapons and vehicles add spice to this otherwise average action game.;
Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones Review;8.6;Great; The Two Thrones provides a satisfying conclusion to the Sands of Time trilogy, with a lot of the same puzzle solving and gorgeous environments you remembered from the previous two ...;
Legend of Heroes: A Tear of Vermillion Review;7.1;Good; This lengthy Japanese role-playing game doesn't break the mold in any way, but it packs in some good-looking anime artwork and tons of characters and story in a portable package.;
Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones Review;8.6;Great; The Two Thrones provides a satisfying conclusion to the Sands of Time trilogy, with a lot of the same puzzle solving and gorgeous environments you remembered from the previous two ...;
Wild Arms Alter Code: F Review;7.2;Good; Wild Arms Alter Code: F remains a bit on the antiquated side despite an update, but it's still a worthy trip down memory lane for series fans.;
Shrek SuperSlam Review;6.9;Fair; Shrek SuperSlam is an easy game to pick up and play, but unless you're a big fan of the license there isn't much to keep you playing.;
Stubbs the Zombie in Rebel Without a Pause Review;7.7;Good; Eating the brains of the living to form a massive army of the undead is extremely satisfying, often hilarious, and, unfortunately, almost painfully brief.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Shrek SuperSlam Review;6.6;Fair; Shrek SuperSlam is an easy game to pick up and play, but unless you're a big fan of the license there isn't much to keep you playing.;
Starship Troopers Review;3.8;Bad; Starship Troopers has little dedication to faithfully re-creating the things that made the film unique, and it's a pretty lousy and technically deficient shooter to boot.;
NTRA Breeders' Cup World Thoroughbred Championships Review;4.6;Poor; The Breeders' Cup may carry a lot of clout in the world of Thoroughbred horseracing, but it doesn't mean much when applied to a shallow horseracing simulation such as this.;
Magna Carta: Tears of Blood Review;7.1;Good; Magna Carta: Tears of Blood is a generally unremarkable game that manages to pull itself together thanks to its story and interesting characters.;
50 Cent: Bulletproof Review;4.8;Poor; Whether you're an action fan looking for a good shooter or a G-Unit fan in search of new material, Bulletproof disappoints across the board.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Crash Tag Team Racing Review;7;Good; The racing isn't the star of the show, and the load times are painful, but Crash Tag Team Racing's supplemental elements pull the whole thing together into a mostly enjoyable ...;
X3: Reunion Review;7.2;Good; X3 features more of the open-ended space exploration and trading of the earlier games, and it has a gorgeous graphics engine;
College Hoops 2K6 Review;8.3;Great; It's not the prettiest looking game, but College Hoops 2K6 still delivers where it counts, as a deep and accurate simulation of NCAA basketball.;
50 Cent: Bulletproof Review;4.8;Poor; Whether you're an action fan looking for a good shooter or a G-Unit fan in search of new material, Bulletproof disappoints across the board.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time Review;8.9;Great; Partners in Time might not have as strong of a script as the previous Mario & Luigi, but it's still another charming, high quality RPG worth any DS owner's while.;
Bejeweled 2 Deluxe Review;7;Good; Bejeweled 2 Deluxe brings the classic puzzle game to the Xbox 360 but doesn't make enough significant changes to make it stand out from the pack.;
Smash TV Review;7.9;Good; As with the other arcade classics currently available on Xbox Live Arcade, the addition of scoreboards, achievements, and online play breathe new life into Smash TV, an already-classic game.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
EyeToy: Kinetic Review;7.5;Good; EyeToy: Kinetic offers a surprisingly good personal training program but does make hearty demands of your lighting and space requirements.;
College Hoops 2K6 Review;8.3;Great; It's not the prettiest looking game, but College Hoops 2K6 still delivers where it counts, as a deep and accurate simulation of NCAA basketball.;
Aeon Flux Review;7.2;Good; Aeon Flux is heavy on style and light on coherency, but there's enough enjoyable action to keep things from flying apart at the seams.;
Need for Speed Most Wanted 5-1-0 Review;6.9;Fair; Need for Speed Most Wanted 5-1-0 has most of what's needed to make a good PSP racing game, but it lacks the biggest one of all: excitement.;
Aeon Flux Review;7.2;Good; Aeon Flux is heavy on style and light on coherency, but there's enough enjoyable action to keep things from flying apart at the seams.;
Infinite Crosswords Review;6.6;Fair; Infinite Crosswords provides a lot of crosswords and a lot of options, but none of them are necessarily better than the ones in your local paper.;
Peter Jackson's King Kong: The Official Game of the Movie Review;8.1;Great; It isn't quite as impressive looking as its console counterparts, and it's a short ride, but there's still a great time to be had with King Kong on the PC.;
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Review;7.3;Good; Like the console versions, Goblet of Fire on the PSP is a worthwhile platforming experience for Potter fans--but the newly included minigames don't add much value.;
Mega Flexicon Review;7.4;Good; It's a race against the clock to solve multiple interconnected crossword puzzles in Mega Flexicon, a fun and challenging take on the classic crossword design.;
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Review;6.5;Fair; Goblet of Fire is a decent game, but exploring the large levels becomes repetitive after a while, and it also fails to effectively leverage the strengths of the DS.;
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Review;6.6;Fair; Goblet of Fire is a decent game, but exploring the large levels becomes repetitive after a while.;
Gauntlet Review;6.7;Fair; Four-player online support makes the Xbox Live Arcade version of this fantasy arcade classic a worthwhile, inexpensive indulgence for nostalgic fans of the good old days of gaming.;
True Crime: New York City Review;4.6;Poor; Even if you forgive the flimsy story and derivative gameplay, you'll have a hard time getting past the game-stopping bugs and glaring technical problems that plague this game.;

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Review;7.3;Good; It's a worthwhile platforming experience for hardcore Potter fans, but some may be put off by all the collection quests and backtracking.;
Hexic HD Review;7.6;Good; Reminiscent of the influential puzzle gaming sensation Bejeweled, Hexic HD is a solid, attractive puzzle game that comes freely preloaded onto the Xbox 360's hard drive.;
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Review;7.3;Good; It's a worthwhile platforming experience for hardcore Potter fans, but some may be put off by all the collection quests and backtracking.;

Peter Jackson's King Kong: The Official Game of the Movie Review;8.2;Great; It won't take you long to blow through King Kong, but its sometimes thrilling, often tense, and always entertaining adventure is absolutely worth checking out.;

Battlefield 2: Special Forces Review;8.1;Great; With its focus on infantry and urban combat, Special Forces delivers more of the intense and insanely fun Battlefield 2 gameplay;
Need for Speed Most Wanted Review;8.4;Great; Most Wanted is great fun, from its hysterical cutscenes to its extremely tense police chases.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
EyeToy: Operation Spy Review;5.9;Mediocre; EyeToy: Operation Spy has got some really cool features, but not enough of them to form a truly substantial game.;
Mutant Storm Reloaded Review;7;Good; Mutant Storm Reloaded has slick, colorful graphics and classic early-'80s arcade shooter roots.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved Review;8.2;Great; Geometry Wars is a refreshingly simple, addictive experience that combines appealing graphics and frantic gameplay.;
Tiger Woods PGA Tour 06 Review;7.8;Good; What it lacks in features and courses, Tiger almost makes up for in pure challenge.;
Ridge Racer 6 Review;8.1;Great; If you've played any recent Ridge Racer game, you know exactly what to expect in Ridge Racer 6--a slick, fast-moving racing game with interesting handling characteristics.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
5 Spot II Review;7.3;Good; Straight out of the back of the Sunday funnies, 5 Spot II is good for a quick fix of simple visual puzzles...and monkeys!;
Alien Shooter Review;6.4;Fair; While the game makes good on its promise of giving you aliens to shoot, the end result is very repetitive.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Dance Dance Revolution Ultramix 3 Review;7.5;Good; Dance Dance Revolution Ultramix 3 incorporates a bunch of new modes and switches up the songlist, but for many less-than-expert players will seem a little too similar to previous games.;
From Russia With Love Review;7;Good; EA's take on Bond's classic adventure is a game of enjoyable moments that are, unfortunately, far too easy to breeze through.;
FIFA 06: Road to FIFA World Cup Review;6;Fair; FIFA 06: Road to FIFA World Cup is inferior to this year's earlier FIFA games in almost every way, and it's not a particularly good soccer game in its own ...;
Quake 4 Review;6.6;Fair; There's a good game in Quake 4, but it's buried under several layers of highly disappointing graphical performance issues.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Fatal Frame III: The Tormented Review;7.6;Good; There are plenty of good scares to be found in Fatal Frame III: The Tormented.;
Amped 3 Review;7.6;Good; The wholly original cut-and-paste visual style of Amped 3--combined with the manic, increasingly crazy energy of the story mode--make it easier to forgive the oft-repetitive and occasionally plain gameplay.;
The Moment of Silence Review;6.4;Fair; There is a certain superficiality to The Moment of Silence that prevents you from getting totally immersed in the story.;
Perfect Dark Zero Review;9;Superb; This awesome, high-tech first-person shooter champions the Xbox 360 with its excellent assortment of single- and multiplayer game types, as well as its incredible good looks and dynamic, intense action.;
NHL 2K6 Review;7.5;Good; It's got new goalie controls and marginally improved graphics, but taken as a whole, NHL 2K6 just isn't as appealing on the 360 as it was on other platforms.;
NBA Live 06 Review;6.4;Fair; First impressions count for a lot, and NBA Live 06 certainly delivers in that regard. However, while the game looks next-gen at times, it doesn't play like it.;
Shadow the Hedgehog Review;4.7;Poor; Shadow the Hedgehog fails to live up to its pedigree due to terrible controls, an uncooperative camera, and an overall lack of effort.;
Shadow the Hedgehog Review;4.8;Poor; Shadow the Hedgehog fails to live up to its pedigree due to terrible controls, an uncooperative camera, and an overall lack of effort.;

Madden NFL 06 Review;7.4;Good; The next-generation of football gaming kicks off with mixed results in Madden NFL 06, a game that's pretty to look at, but has less to it than you'd probably expect.;
Tony Hawk's American Wasteland Review;6.6;Fair; American Wasteland on the 360 runs in a high-enough resolution to show off every single ugly little flaw that isn't as apparent in other versions of this otherwise-decent skateboarding game.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Condemned: Criminal Origins Review;8;Great; This first-person action game hits you like a sledgehammer with its astounding, stunningly creepy presentation, but it sacrifices opportunities for more shocks and surprises by settling for repetition.;
Need for Speed Most Wanted Review;8.4;Great; Most Wanted is great fun on the Xbox 360, from its hysterical cutscenes to its extremely tense police chases.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.

Infected Review;7.2;Good; There's a real raw, visceral satisfaction to Infected, which is undermined by a short, single-minded story mode and an ambitious but inherently flawed multiplayer game.;
WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW 2006 Review;8.9;Great; Yuke's delivers one of the best wrestling games ever released on the PlayStation 2 in its latest SmackDown! vs. RAW installment.;
Gun Review;6.4;Fair; On the Xbox 360, this short Old West action adventure feels old all right. And its fairly fun shooting action is dragged down by a slapdash presentation.;
Neopets: The Darkest Faerie Review;6.1;Fair; Neopets: The Darkest Faerie is a much stronger license than it is a game, as it's plagued by overly expansive environments and poorly realized combat sequences.;
City of Villains Review;8.2;Great; City of Villains doesn't always make you feel evil, but it's an engrossing bookend to City of Heroes' attractive MMO concept.;
Kingdom of Paradise Review;8;Great; If you're looking for a great-looking martial arts-themed role-playing game to have on the go, you'll find that Kingdom of Paradise lives up to its name.;
Suikoden Tactics Review;7.6;Good; Suikoden Tactics offers solid turn-based strategy gameplay with a couple of unique twists that make it fun for newcomers and veterans alike.;
Call of Duty 2 Review;8.8;Great; On the Xbox 360, this first-rate WWII first-person shooter is every bit as intense and hard-hitting as the PC version of the game.;
Need for Speed Most Wanted Review;8.4;Great; Need for Speed Most Wanted is a great racing game that injects new life into the series thanks to its creative use of law enforcement.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.

NBA 2K6 Review;8.3;Great; NBA 2K6 looks fantastic if you have an HDTV, but the gameplay will seem familiar to you if you've played one of the other versions of the game already.;
Sonic Rush Review;8.2;Great; Sonic Rush adds some moves, but it also stays true to the series' roots as a great side-scrolling platformer.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Castle Shikigami 2 Review;7.8;Good; Good things come in cheap packages if Castle Shikigami 2 is any indication. This arcade-style shoot-'em-up features a unique premise, lots of tough levels, and good variety.;
Donkey Kong Country 3 Review;7.8;Good; Donkey Kong Country 3 isn't a huge leap over DKC2, but it's still a first-rate platformer with plenty to see and do.;
Mario Kart DS Review;9.2;Superb; Mario Kart DS represents a significant step forward for Nintendo's much-loved racing series, and not only because it's the first to feature online play.;
Sniper Elite Review;7.6;Good; Sniper Elite offers a lengthy single-player game full of tense and rewarding moments, but it requires a lot of patience to truly enjoy.;
Kameo: Elements of Power Review;8.7;Great; Plenty of original, funny, visually stunning, and fun-filled moments await in Kameo: Elements of Power, which is the first Xbox 360 action adventure game, as well as a standard-setter.;
Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King Review;9;Superb; Dragon Quest VIII is a charming classic-style RPG that doesn't stint on difficulty, graphical beauty, or fun.;
Half-Life 2 Review;8.3;Great; Half-Life 2 faithfully captures the excellent single-player gameplay found in last year's hit PC game, but it also suffers from an erratic frame rate and there's no multiplayer.;
Zathura Review;5.7;Mediocre; Zathura is a brief and generic action game that does nothing to distinguish itself from the glut of similar--and cheaper--games on the market.;
Zoo Keeper DX Review;7.3;Good; Zoo Keeper DX is a solid, though entirely unoriginal, puzzle game.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Zathura Review;5.6;Mediocre; Zathura is a brief and generic action game that does nothing to distinguish itself from the glut of similar--and cheaper--games on the market.;
SOCOM Fireteam Bravo Review;8.7;Great; Fireteam Bravo effectively captures the spirit of previous SOCOM games on the PlayStation 2, making it easily the best shooter yet for the PSP.;
Mario Party 7 Review;6.5;Fair; Mario Party spins its wheels for the seventh year in a row, though the formula will still prove enjoyable for some casual group gaming.;
Earth 2160 Review;7.3;Good; Earth 2160 features interesting gameplay and beautiful graphics, but it's dragged down by its badly paced and terribly told campaign.;

Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex Review;5.9;Mediocre; Sluggish controls and lifeless gameplay make Ghost in the Shell worth playing only for loyal fans of the anime, and even then it isn't worth more than a rental.;
Suzuki TT Superbikes Review;6.9;Fair; Though patient motorcycle-simulation fans will see past Suzuki TT Superbikes' quirks and appreciate its authenticity, many will shy away from the game's single-track format, twitchy handling, and claustrophobic environment.;
The Lord of the Rings: Tactics Review;6.5;Fair; Middle-earth's forces of good and evil are a perfect fit for a turn-based strategy game, but this one doesn't put them to particularly good use.;
The Matrix: Path of Neo Review;6.8;Fair; Path of Neo is a good brawler at its core, but the PC version is seriously lacking in comparison to its console counterparts.;
Ikari Warriors Review;8.1;Great; Ikari Warriors was a great arcade game, and this is a great version of that arcade game.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Mega Man Battle Network 5: Double Team Review;7.5;Good; Capcom has taken what was already a decent role-playing game on the GBA and made it better on the DS by taking advantage of the system's unique hardware features.;
The Matrix: Path of Neo Review;7.3;Good; Path of Neo is a chaotic but pretty good brawler worth the time for those who still think fondly of the Matrix series.;
NBA 06 Review;6.2;Fair; After spending a year on the bench, NBA 06 comes back featuring an interesting new wrinkle. However, Sony's game still isn't refined enough to warrant a spot in your starting ...;
The Matrix: Path of Neo Review;7.3;Good; Path of Neo is a chaotic but pretty good brawler worth the time for those who still think fondly of the Matrix series.;
Without Warning Review;4.6;Poor; This hackneyed terrorist shooter is without story, without characters, without originality, and most importantly, without fun.;
The Movies Review;8.2;Great; The Movies proves to be an accessible and good-spirited tycoon game, and its moviemaking tools offer a surprisingly deep amount of control. But the disconnection between these elements is noticeable.;
Karaoke Revolution Party Review;7.4;Good; Karaoke Revolution Party makes a good party game, especially if you've got all the necessary peripherals, but it's no greater than the song list, which is too diverse for its ...;
Without Warning Review;4.6;Poor; This hackneyed terrorist shooter is without story, without characters, without originality, and most importantly, without fun.;

Namco Museum 50th Anniversary Review;5.5;Mediocre; It may have 16 solid arcade hits, but if you care at all about visual accuracy in your arcade compilations, this package most definitely isn't for you.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Jetfighter 2015 Review;6.2;Fair; A blast from the past in more ways than one, Jetfighter 2015 feels more like a shooter than an air combat game.;
Call of Duty 2: Big Red One Review;7;Good; While it offers an interesting and varied campaign, Big Red One doesn't quite nail down the intense feel of World War II infantry combat.;
Cold War Review;6.5;Fair; Splinter Cell fans will be in for a familiar experience in Cold War, a competent but unremarkable stealth action game that puts you in the middle of a Soviet conspiracy.;
Call of Duty 2: Big Red One Review;7;Good; While it offers an interesting and varied campaign, Big Red One doesn't quite nail down the intense feel of World War II infantry combat.;
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 3: Mutant Nightmare Review;5.3;Mediocre; Mutant Nightmare is yet another Turtles sequel that does little to change the series' ever-decreasing reputation.;
Dynasty Warriors 5: Xtreme Legends Review;6.3;Fair; Xtreme Legends is the archetypal Dynasty Warriors expansion pack, adding more ways to experience the same tired gameplay.;
Call of Duty 2: Big Red One Review;7;Good; While it offers an interesting and varied campaign, Big Red One doesn't quite nail down the intense feel of World War II infantry combat.;
Star Wars: Battlefront II Review;6.8;Fair; It's got some of the console and PC versions' mechanics, but the lack of a story-based campaign and online multiplayer sucks much of the fun out of this PSP shooter.;
Castlevania: Curse of Darkness Review;6.7;Fair; Despite a solid combat system and a decent presentation, this latest Castlevania is cursed with extremely monotonous levels that prevent it from being an engaging action adventure game.;
Cold War Review;6.5;Fair; Splinter Cell fans will be in for a familiar experience in Cold War, a competent but unremarkable stealth action game that puts you in the middle of a Soviet conspiracy.;

Star Wars: Battlefront II Review;8.1;Great; The incremental additions found in Battlefront II improve upon the overall formula, resulting in another quality Star Wars game.;
From Russia With Love Review;7;Good; EA's take on Bond's classic adventure is a game of enjoyable moments that are, unfortunately, far too easy to breeze through.;
Sniper Elite Review;7.4;Good; It's not for those with short attention spans, but patient players who aren't squeamish should enjoy Sniper Elite's tense and methodically paced action.;

Saints and Sinners Bingo Review;8.2;Great; Saints and Sinners Bingo reinvents one of the oldest games in the book with charm and strategy.;
Scrabble Rack Attack Deluxe Review;5.6;Mediocre; Scrabble Rack Attack Deluxe isn't that interesting, and the useless Scrabble license tacked on seems to make it that much more lacking.;
Scrabble Blast Deluxe Review;5.1;Mediocre; Quite simply, for this type of gameplay, which is not pure Scrabble, there are better alternatives out there.;
Slingo Review;5.1;Mediocre; Slingo doesn't even capture the formula well enough, let alone improve upon it.;
Tradewinds 2 Review;7.2;Good; Sail the Caribbean in search of wealth and high adventure in this breezy, simple, and entertaining game of trade and ship combat.;
From Russia With Love Review;7;Good; EA's take on Bond's classic adventure is a game of enjoyable moments that are, unfortunately, far too easy to breeze through.;
Pizza Frenzy Review;7.4;Good; While Pizza Frenzy isn't much of a frenzy, it's still a unique and entertaining game.;
Spin & Win Review;4.7;Poor; Spin & Win has one thing going for it--novelty--but even that won't make it worth playing.;
Astroblasters Review;7.3;Good; This throwback 2D space shooter seems to have forgotten that half the fun of the genre is born from a wicked level of difficulty.;
Castlevania: Curse of Darkness Review;6.8;Fair; Despite a solid combat system and a good presentation, this latest Castlevania is cursed with extremely monotonous levels that prevent it from being an engaging action-adventure game.;

Cubis Gold 2 Review;7;Good; Match multicolored gelatin-like cubes in rows or columns of three from an unconventional isometric perspective.;
Oasis Review;8.5;Great; Defeat the barbarian hordes threatening ancient Egypt in this excellent turn-based strategy game, which has plenty of depth despite how easy it is to start playing.;
Bespelled Review;6.6;Fair; Bespelled is certainly entertaining and addictive, but there's no significant addition that makes getting this deluxe version necessary.;
Combo Chaos Review;5.5;Mediocre; Take the classic game of memory, give it a frenetic pace, and you've got Combo Chaos.;Video Producer/Shooter/Editor. Mass Consumer of Television &amp
Pixelus Review;6.9;Fair; Pixelus has some things going for it, but it still doesn't shape up to be any more than a fairly decent puzzle game.;
Mortimer and the Enchanted Castle Review;6.2;Fair; Mortimer needs you to guide him through an ominous castle in this often-tough puzzle game, in which you must strategically place special tiles to ensure Mortimer's safe passage.;
Alien Sky Review;6.5;Fair; Alien Sky is an unpretentious Galaga knockoff in which your little spaceship must relentlessly dodge from side to side while shooting at endless fleets of alien fighters.;
Alchemy Review;6.5;Fair; Alchemy is a solid puzzle game, although it can get quite difficult. Check this one out if you're serious about puzzle games.;Video Producer/Shooter/Editor. Mass Consumer of Television &amp

One Piece: Grand Battle Review;6;Fair; Fans of the series will love One Piece's visuals but will be disappointed with just about every other aspect of the game.;
Taito Legends Review;7.1;Good; The lack of light gun support drags down Operation Wolf, but with games like Elevator Action and Bubble Bobble on board, Taito Legends offers good classic arcade action at a ...;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Lego Star Wars Review;7.6;Good; Traveller's Tales delivers a short but inviting adventure that makes deft use of both of its almost arbitrary licenses.;

Tony Hawk's American Sk8land Review;6;Fair; Sk8land looks slick and controls like a Tony Hawk game should, but its skate park designs are weak and its story mode missions lack creativity.;
Midway Arcade Treasures 3 Review;6.3;Fair; This compilation of arcade driving games proves that you can take the game out of the arcade--it's just not much fun.;
Shining Force Neo Review;7;Good; The latest installment in this beloved strategy role-playing series is a major departure--it's a quirky, fast-paced, tough hack-and-slash action RPG.;
Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories Review;8.6;Great; Liberty City Stories has its share of minor issues, but it gets enough of the GTA look and feel in there to be an exciting portable game overall.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.

Shattered Union Review;7.9;Good; Despite some flaws with its strategic game, Shattered Union is a fun, turn-based wargame that anyone can pick up and enjoy.;

Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi Review;7;Good; It has little in common with previous Budokai games, but there's still enough here to keep DBZ fans entertained.;
The Sims 2 Review;6.5;Fair; The Sims 2 loses something in translation from PC to consoles. Namely, its addictive, entertaining gameplay.;

Gretzky NHL '06 Review;6.3;Fair; This is a fairly lackluster game of hockey that doesn't really need to be in your PSP collection.;

D.I.C.E. Review;4.4;Poor; D.I.C.E. the game is a dull, repetitive, and often frustrating experience that should be avoided.;

FIFA 06 Review;7.6;Good; FIFA 06 is a decent soccer game that lacks real depth, but it's still fun to play solo or with friends.;
Blitz: The League Review;8.6;Great; Blitz: The League is easily the best football you'll play all year.;
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed: Never Ending Tomorrow Review;4.4;Poor; The action here is a complete mess that can't be salvaged, even with copious amounts of fan service and esoteric references to the Gundam universe.;

Links Course Challenge: Chateau Whistler Review;6.4;Fair; A dense interface and unforgiving controls will keep this pint-sized golf simulator from appealing to anyone but the most devout duffers.;
Jigsaw 365 Review;5.2;Mediocre; A puzzle a day makes for little more than artificial value.;
Mah Jong Quest Review;7.5;Good; Mah Jong Quest takes the age-old tile-matching game Shanghai and throws a few unique twists into the mix.;
Mah Jong Medley Review;6.1;Fair; It's got variety, but it lacks longevity.;

Jamdat Sports NFL 2006 Review;7.9;Good; With NFL 2006, Jamdat Sports maintains the momentum it began with last year's game, but it doesn't improve a whole lot on the formula.;
Jigs@w Puzzle Platinum Edition Review;5.8;Mediocre; It's functional but unremarkable jigsaw puzzling for serious enthusiasts only.;
Fiber Twig Review;6.8;Fair; It might have a funny name, but the challenge of Fiber Twig is anything but.;Video Producer/Shooter/Editor. Mass Consumer of Television &amp
Heavy Weapon Deluxe Review;6.7;Fair; Heavy Weapon Deluxe has great weapon effects and a generally solid look, but the gameplay and control options make the game a little too shallow to recommend.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Insaniquarium Deluxe Review;6.9;Fair;" Insaniquarium Deluxe is an addictive game... But the ""deluxe"" part of the package isn't worth $20.";
Feeding Frenzy Review;6.7;Fair; Eat your heart out in this undersea action game, in which you guide a fish around as it swallows up anything smaller. Fun, simple gameplay makes this one a fine ...;

Flip Words Review;7.5;Good; If Boggle and Wheel of Fortune had a child, its name would be Flip Words.;Video Producer/Shooter/Editor. Mass Consumer of Television &amp
Gold Miner Joe Review;6.9;Fair; There's absolutely nothing to distinguish Gold Miner Joe from all the other 2D platformers, so your enjoyment of this game depends entirely on your affinity for the genre.;
Two Feet Texas Hold 'Em Review;5;Mediocre; Two Feet Texas Hold 'Em plays a competent game of poker, but its primitive production values make it difficult to recommend.;
Inspector Parker Review;8.7;Great; Inspector Parker's logic puzzle will have you stuck in front of your computer for hours at a time.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Chicken Invaders: The Next Wave Review;5.8;Mediocre; Because the first Chicken Invaders was so great, it needed a sequel, right? Right? Hello?;
Charm Tale Review;7.2;Good; This enjoyable fairy-tale-inspired puzzle game tests your pattern recognition by having you quickly match crystalline shapes on a playing field to uncover colorful images.;
Cosmic Bugs Review;4.9;Poor; Cosmic Bugs might play like an old arcade classic with a twist, but it doesn't quite click.;Video Producer/Shooter/Editor. Mass Consumer of Television &amp
Darwinia Review;8.5;Great; Darwinia is a brilliant and addictive experience that's unlike anything you've played before.;
Chainz Review;6.9;Fair; A solid variation on Bejeweled's pattern-matching formula, Chainz invites you to clear the playing field of a never-ending supply of color-coded puzzle pieces by rotating them into proper position.;
Dino and Aliens Review;6.4;Fair; Simple action-puzzle mechanics, cutesy visuals, and a jaunty soundtrack make Dino and Aliens a good fit for the kids.;

Bookworm Deluxe Review;7.2;Good; Whether you're a vocab virtuoso or a remedial reader, you'll find a suitable challenge in Bookworm Deluxe.;
Gold Fever Review;6.9;Fair; Though it offers some level of charm, Gold Fever just isn't as compelling as many other puzzle games.;
Super Text Twist Review;7.5;Good; Super Text Twist is basically a computerized version of your common word jumble.;
Hardwood Solitaire Deluxe Review;7.6;Good; It's every solitaire game you could ever think of in an attractive and flexible package.;
Super Collapse! II Review;0;; With four different game modes, Super Collapse! II has something for everyone.;
Hamsterball Review;7.6;Good; Hamsterball successfully combines the charm of Super Monkey Ball with Marble Madness-like gameplay for a fun and easy-to-play puzzle game.;
Zzed Review;5.2;Mediocre; The somewhat sloppy puzzle gameplay of Zzed pales in comparison to the game's clumsy, hand-hewn visuals and its English-as-a-second-language dialogue.;
BreakQuest Review;8.4;Great; BreakQuest takes the classic brick-breaking formula and packs it with enough manic effects and crazy power-ups to satisfy even the most discerning twitch gamers.;
Atomaders Review;5.9;Mediocre; For better or for worse, Atomaders is a slightly updated take on Space Invaders.;
Bankshot Billiards Review;8.1;Great; No matter what type of pool you like to shoot, Bankshot Billiards has something for everyone.;

Bejeweled 2 Deluxe Review;8.4;Great; Bejeweled 2 takes an already-solid puzzle game and adds more modes and sharper graphics to make an addictive game even more so. Consider yourself warned.;Video Producer/Shooter/Editor. Mass Consumer of Television &amp

Gutterball 2 Review;6.1;Fair; Gutterball 2 is a fairly by-the-numbers arcade bowling game that's quick and easy to play, but isn't likely to hold your interest for long.;
Word Mojo Review;6.9;Fair; Like a solo version of Scrabble, the fun you can have with Word Mojo is literally limited only by your vocabulary.;

Tumble Bugs Review;7.6;Good; Tumble Bugs might be a Zuma clone, but it's still a great game.;Video Producer/Shooter/Editor. Mass Consumer of Television &amp
Trivia Machine Review;7.9;Good; Trivia Machine isn't an especially remarkable game of trivia, but the sheer number of questions makes it worth the price of admission for trivia buffs.;
Shape Shifter Review;7.3;Good; Shape Shifter slowly but surely ratchets up the multitasking puzzle action until your brain simply seizes up.;
Ruckus Buck's Dangerous Mines review;6;Fair; If the copy of Minesweeper that comes with Windows isn't enough for you, you might want to check out Ruckus Buck's Dangerous Mines.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Mozaki Blocks Deluxe Review;6.3;Fair; If you've played enough Tetris and are ready to move on, look to Mozaki Blocks.;Video Producer/Shooter/Editor. Mass Consumer of Television &amp
Mah Jong Tiles Deluxe Review;5;Mediocre; For the Mah Jong fiends out there, better options exist.;

Wheel of Fortune Deluxe review;6.4;Fair; Wheel of Fortune Deluxe lets you step up to the big wheel to try your luck at more than 2,000 word puzzles.;

Upwords Deluxe Review;7.2;Good; This game is a faithful adaptation of Upwords, meaning that it's only as good as the original is.;
Wheel of Fortune 2005 for Prizes Review;6.6;Fair; You are restricted to only playing three games of Wheel of Fortune competitively a day, which stifles the game significantly.;
Namco Museum Battle Collection Review;7.5;Good; With its longer-than-normal game list and attention to detail, this is one of the better versions of Namco Museum to be released.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Sonic Gems Collection Review;6.3;Fair;" Despite the inclusion of some fan favorites and rarities, most of the games in Sonic Gems Collection simply aren't good enough to warrant being called ""classics.""";

Pipeline Review;7.6;Good; Plumbing has never been as fun as it is in the race-against-the-clock puzzle game, Pipeline.;
Nintendogs Review;9.1;Superb; You'd have to have a cold heart indeed to not be charmed by the bright eyes and madly wagging tails of the wonderfully lifelike Nintendogs.;

Madden NFL 06 Review;7.4;Good; Madden NFL 06 for the DS is a game that has eliminated most of the ugly bugs from last year's entry, but it still doesn't manage to rise much above ...;
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3D Review;7.5;Good; It's technically impressive, but that doesn't automatically grant it the same level of playability fans have come to expect from games with Tony Hawk's name on them.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Roots: Gates of Chaos Review;8.3;Great; The Roots: Gates of Chaos is standing on the shoulders of giants here, and RPG-starved N-Gage gamers will reap the sweet fruit of this copycat move.;
Bases Loaded Review;6.8;Fair; You can have a fine time with Bases Loaded in short spurts, but don't expect the game to hearken back to the good old NES days.;
BloodRayne 2 Review;6;Fair; The notion of the exact same game from last year coming out--now on the PC, with serious control issues and graphical hangups--is kind of an offensive one.;
Madden NFL 06 Review;7.3;Good; Madden NFL 06 is a solid football game, but it's also primarily just a roster update to last year's game.;
Pac 'n Roll Review;7.1;Good; If you're looking for a puzzler/platformer that will suffice for killing a few minutes at a time, you can do a lot worse than this game.;
Advance Wars: Dual Strike Review;9.2;Superb; Advance Wars: Dual Strike significantly broadens the scope of this very deep and incredibly fun strategy series while not messing with the fundamentals that made it so great.;

The Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction Review;8.2;Great; Hulk fans are sure to have a blast smashing their way through every destructible obstacle the game throws at them.;
CS Poker Slots Review;5.4;Mediocre; A stripped-down feature set and an acute pacing problem make it even harder to recommend this game, whose concept is only marginal to begin with.;
Xanadu Next Review;6.6;Fair; A competent dungeon crawler marred by some presentation and design shortcomings, Xanadu is a bare-bones action RPG that we recommend only to more forgiving fans of the genre.;
Glimmerati Review;8.1;Great; Glimmerati's combination of simple driving with an engaging, character-driven plot makes it one of the N-Gage's better games.;
Hexcite Fusion Review;7.2;Good; Hexcite Fusion is an interesting puzzle game because it calls upon spatial-reasoning skills that most people don't use very often.;
Harry Potter Find Scabbers Review;5.1;Mediocre; Almost anything would prove more entertaining than this maze-based game.;
Death Jr. Review;6.5;Fair; As periodically intense and initially charming as Death Jr. can be, the whole of the game isn't engaging.;
Hello Kitty: Roller Rescue Review;7;Good; For the adolescent girls it's targeted at, the game does a fine job at capturing the cuteness of the Sanrio universe in video game form.;
Advent Rising Review;6.3;Fair; Advent Rising is a disappointing effort on all fronts, and probably isn't worth your time.;
Metal Slug 4 & 5 Review;7.5;Good; It's likely that only those players who have already acquired a taste for Metal Slug's rich blend of crazy, manic violence and goofy humor will fully appreciate this package.;
Geist Review;7.8;Good; The shooter portions of Geist aren't all that special, but there's a lot more to this game than meets the eye.;

Sigma Star Saga Review;7.2;Good; Sigma Star Saga has a great concept that was clearly inspired by any number of 16-bit classics, but it doesn't quite measure up to them.;
Outlaw Tennis Review;7.1;Good; Outlaw Tennis is a fun and accessible tennis game with some playful gameplay touches, but it's hampered by a dully sophomoric sense of humor.;
Madden NFL 06 Review;8.2;Great; Madden NFL 06 is a highly playable game of football, but in comparison with the leaps forward the franchise has made in previous years, 06 feels like a false start.;
Codename: Panzers Phase Two Review;8.3;Great; It's clear that Stormregion didn't need to fix much in Phase One, and so Phase Two plays it safe by offering more of the same.;
Super Yum Yum Review;8.2;Great; Super Yum Yum manages to be an excellent puzzle game without complex gameplay or network muliplayer.;
Madden NFL 06 Review;8.1;Great; Madden NFL 06 is a highly playable game of football, but in comparison with the leaps forward the franchise has made in previous years, 06 feels like a false start.;

Robotron: 2084 Review;3;Bad; Robotron: 2084 is a sloppy, incomplete port that's not worth your mobile dollar.;
Dungeon Siege II Review;7.9;Good; Dungeon Siege II is a solid effort that manages to improve on the first game to deliver a lengthy, combat-heavy dungeon hack that will certainly please fans of the genre.;
Absolute Light Up Review;8.2;Great; Absolute Light Up is a more inventive puzzler than most, and should be considered by any fan of brain-teasers.;
EyeToy: Play 2 Review;7.8;Good; If you are interested in an Eye Toy but don't yet have one, you should skip buying Play and proceed directly to Play 2, as it's almost universally better than ...;
Madden NFL 06 Review;7;Good; In many ways, Madden is vastly superior to its lower-end competition, which makes its few--albeit serious--shortcomings all the more surprising.;
Graffiti Kingdom Review;7.2;Good; Despite the lackluster action and brief story, Graffiti Kingdom is definitely entertaining for anyone with even the slightest flicker of creative ambition.;
Lord of the Rings Trilogy Review;8.5;Great; This game's royal production values stand out in a crowded field, as does its lengthy, challenging campaign.;
Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story 2D Review;7.1;Good; Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story is mildly amusing for a while, but once you learn how to make good use of the team throw maneuver, the challenge and the appeal ...;
Heads Up Hold 'Em Review;4.5;Poor; The lack of multiplayer, along with an AI that is easily exploited, makes the game difficult to recommend.;
Pitfall: The Lost Expedition Glacier Review;7.1;Good; Pitfall: The Lost Expedition Glacier is a typical platformer with some inventive obstacles.;
Turbo 21 Review;7.1;Good; You can easily see the addictive potential of Turbo 21, despite its simplicity.;
Star Wars: Puzzle Blaster Review;6;Fair; Even though some of the game pieces bear traits specific to the character they depict, this middling action-puzzle game actually has very little to do with the movies.;
Delta Force: Black Hawk Down Review;5.7;Mediocre; Black Hawk Down's dated gameplay design and presentation just don't measure up compared to other modern combat shooters.;
Poppit! Review;7.2;Good; This casual offering's connectivity with the larger Pogo network, which offers raffle drawings and prizes, makes it immediately more compelling than most of the competition.;
The X-Files: The Deserter Review;6.6;Fair; This game's formulation won't disappoint fans of the show, but it may eventually turn them off with its seemingly insuperable sticking points.;
Snake Mayhem Review;7.4;Good; Even though you probably won't be playing it on a black-and-white Nokia any more, the gameplay in Snake Mayhem is just as good as it ever was, and its remodeled ...;
Harvest Moon: More Friends of Mineral Town Review;7.6;Good; More Friends of Mineral Town is merely the original game with a female lead and male suitors. This being said, the game still holds up nicely.;
Herbie Fully Loaded Review;4;Poor; Herbie: Fully Loaded is nothing more than a hastily delivered cash-in on the popularity of a summer film.;
Jewel Quest Review;6.7;Fair; Jewel Quest is a strong puzzle game, but that doesn't mean you can't get by playing the online version.;
Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon 2 Summit Strike Review;8.2;Great; Summit Strike is every bit as enjoyable as its predecessor, with a varied campaign, wide-open levels, and a wealth of multiplayer options and modes.;
Delta Force: Black Hawk Down Review;5.7;Mediocre; Black Hawk Down's dated gameplay design and presentation just don't measure up compared to other modern combat shooters.;
Falcon 4.0: Allied Force Review;8.9;Great; It took seven years, a number of false starts, and one of the most devoted fan communities in existence, but the release of Falcon 4.0: Allied Force shows that its ...;

Jeopardy! Deluxe Review;6;Fair; Jeopardy! Deluxe brings the familiar answer-and-question formula of the popular game show to your PC.;
Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Lockdown Review;7.6;Good; Despite some general slowdown issues, and some enemy encounters that are uncharacteristically poorly designed, Lockdown is a good update to an excellent game.;
Tri-Peaks Solitaire Review;7.8;Good; You'll probably be addicted to its simple yet pervasive gameplay, but maybe not long enough to win anything.;
Star Wars: Battle Above Coruscant Review;7.3;Good; Battle Above Coruscant isn't revolutionary by any means, but it's a competent vertically scrolling shooter with decent level design and game length.;
Echo: Secrets of the Lost Cavern Review;6.5;Fair; Echo relies on its unique premise to compensate for an otherwise by-the-numbers adventure game.;
Atlantis Review;7;Good; Atlantis is fast-paced and easy to pick up and play, making it a good game for novice and veteran players alike.;

Diner Dash Review;9.1;Superb; Diner Dash is one of the best casual games we've played yet.;
Scarlotti's Mafia Wars 2 Review;8;Great; This rip-roaring trip through the seedy underworld of organized crime is a lot of fun.;
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Review;4;Poor; This factory comes off more like a real industrial complex than the fantastic playground of a fop who makes candy with magical midgets.;
Colosseum: Road to Freedom Review;6;Fair; Colosseum has a few fun moments, but they're mired in dull hack-and-slash gameplay that isn't compelling or rewarding enough to make the game worth playing.;
Tennis Titans Review;6.4;Fair; Tennis Titans has been dumbed down to the point of tedium.;
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Review;2.5;Terrible; It's a good thing that the chocolate factory's famed glass elevator doesn't really exist, because after playing this game you might be tempted to throw yourself down the shaft.;
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Review;4;Poor; This factory comes off more like a real industrial complex than the fantastic playground of a fop who makes candy with magical midgets.;
Tic-a-Tac 21 Review;8.5;Great; Once you pick up this compelling puzzle mechanic, it's not easy to put down.;
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Review;4;Poor; This factory comes off more like a real industrial complex than the fantastic playground of a fop who makes candy with magical midgets.;

Monopoly Review;7.5;Good; Monopoly is a slick mobile board game from front to back, thanks to its highly usable interface.;
Milton Bradley Board Games Review;6.3;Fair; Unfortunately for all three of these games, there's something about the gameplay that gets lost in translation.;
Love Triangle: Dating Challenge Review;6;Fair; Love Triangle should be a free Internet Flash game, not a commercial release.;
Harlem Globetrotters Review;5;Mediocre; Globetrotters will meet neither your basketball nor your rhythm game needs.;
Chuzzle Review;7.1;Good; Chuzzle is an adorable match-three game with a great variety of options.;
Star Wars Lightsaber Combat Review;5.2;Mediocre; This 2D fighter barely qualifies for minigame status.;
Will of Steel Review;4;Poor; Frustrating gameplay, bad graphics, and a careless regard for historical detail make Will of Steel a trying experience.;
Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory 3D Review;6.4;Fair; Suffice it to say, this isn't the version of Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory you want to buy.;
Luxor Review;7.1;Good; This is a good Zuma clone, but most players will probably prefer the original.;
Hero's Quest Review;5;Mediocre; Hero's Quest has the groundwork for an interesting and rich game, but it falls short in too many ways to be ignored.;
Out of the Park Baseball 6.5 Review;7.4;Good; Basically, OOTP 6.5 is OOTP 6 on steroids.;
Spy Hunter Review;5.6;Mediocre; Even though everything looks more or less the way it should, the scaled-down Spy Hunter experience isn't nearly as much fun as the original.;
AMF Xtreme Bowling for Prizes Review;5.9;Mediocre; AMF Xtreme Bowling for Prizes is a bowling game that does everything well, except for the bowling aspect, which makes going after the prizes a tedious endeavor.;
Makai Kingdom: Chronicles of the Sacred Tome Review;7.5;Good; Even though it feels like worn territory, Makai Kingdom is still a charming and intelligent game with enough depth to sustain the gameplay long after the story is finished.;
Fox Sports Football 06 Review;6.1;Fair; With only seven-on-seven action and bogus AI, Fox Sports Football 2006 is stuck in 2004.;
Cruise Ship Tycoon Review;4.3;Poor; Tycoon games succeed only when the strategy involved is rich, and since it isn't here, Cruise Ship Tycoon fails thoroughly.;
Wrestling Spirit Review;7.3;Good; The absence of serious depth in Wrestling Spirit is offset by the entertainment value of role-playing as a muscle-bound freak who bashes people over the head with chairs for a ...;
Nanostray Review;6.5;Fair; Unfortunately, underneath Nanostray's excellent presentation is a game that's not nearly as good as its sources of inspiration.;
FlatOut Review;7.9;Good; For those who just want to race fast, wreck hard, and look good doing it, FlatOut fits the bill.;
Sphinx and the Cursed Mummy Review;6.6;Fair; You'll probably be more frustrated than satisfied by the type of gameplay Sphinx has to offer.;
FlatOut Review;7.9;Good; For those who just want to race fast, wreck hard, and look good doing it, FlatOut fits the bill.;
Gameloft Backgammon Review;7.2;Good; Flaws aside, you can still play a good game of backgammon on your phone, which is ultimately all that matters.;
Marshall Faulk Football Review;2.6;Terrible; If you're dying to have Marshall Faulk on your phone, a homemade wallpaper will serve you better.;
Necromania: Traps of Darkness Review;3.7;Bad; Necromania's poorly implemented design, clunky interface, Stone Age graphics, and horrible sound effects combine to form a product that is impossible to recommend to anyone.;
Fullmetal Alchemist 2: Curse of the Crimson Elixir Review;7.3;Good; Fullmetal Alchemist 2: Curse of the Crimson Elixir offers a surprisingly varied and entertaining experience that captures some of the best aspects of the anime in its gameplay.;

Mobile Suit Gundam: Gundam vs. Zeta Gundam Review;6.6;Fair; Mobile Suit Gundam: Gundam vs. Zeta Gundam doesn't do anything to broaden the reach of the franchise, but it gives fans exactly what they want--and plenty of it.;

Bubble Ducky Review;5.3;Mediocre; Children respond to fanciful imagery and high levels of interactivity, none of which can be found here.;
RYL: Path of the Emperor Review;5.6;Mediocre; RYL: Path of the Emperor represents a throwback in the current market, offering mostly lackluster visuals, a staid player-versus-environment game, and a standard sort of guild-versus-guild, player-versus-player system.;
Poker Superstars Review;4.9;Poor; It's too bad that Poker Superstars' solid gameplay is wrapped in such a shallow, ugly package.;
Ms. Pac-Man Review;7.3;Good; The only major detriment of Ms. Pac-Man on mobile is that you can, for only a little more money, play Ms. Pac-Man for Prizes--the same game with additional benefits.;
Sid Meier's Pirates! Review;8.6;Great; Sid Meier's Pirates! packs more adventure in just 30 minutes than most games do in their entirety.;
Samurai by Jamdat Review;6.9;Fair; It's a shame Jamdat didn't incorporate difficulty levels, because it's the major thing preventing Samurai from being a good game.;
Othello Review;7.7;Good; Othello world champion Takeshi Murakami will want to stick with his computer simulation, but all others will find this game challenging and fun in equal measure.;
Snowball Fight II Review;4.6;Poor; While at one time the game might have been charming in its simplicity, it's now just getting old.;
Riviera: The Promised Land Review;8.7;Great; Riviera is as diverse as it is formulaic, but it ultimately exceeds expectations thanks to its engrossing story and slick production values.;
Marshal Wyatt Earp Review;3.4;Bad; Power-ups, new weapons, different sorts of enemies, time limits, and boss fights are all missing from the equation, and so is the fun.;
NCAA Football 06 Review;8.8;Great; The improved game balance and new features make NCAA Football 06 arguably the best in the series, as well as a game that's a must-have for college football fanatics.;
NCAA Football 06 Review;8.8;Great; The improved game balance and new features make NCAA Football 06 arguably the best in the series, as well as a game that's a must-have for college football fanatics.;
Flipnic: Ultimate Pinball Review;6.9;Fair; Once you're past Flipnic's pretty outer layer, you'll probably find that the game is a little too stripped-down for your tastes.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Fantastic 4 Review;7.1;Good; Fantastic 4 is a solid beat-'em-up and a respectable movie-to-game translation.;
Halo 2 Multiplayer Map Pack Review;8.7;Great; The nine new maps are outstanding, making one of the best-ever multiplayer shooters even better.;
Killer7 Review;8;Great; It's one of the most unusual, politically charged, and thought-provoking video games since Metal Gear Solid.;
Jamdat Mini Golf Review;8;Great; Apart from its hot seat multiplayer, which fails to impress, Mini Golf is an airtight game that's difficult to critique.;
Word Heaven Review;7.3;Good; Word Heaven is one of the better mobile word puzzles you can download.;
Killer7 Review;8.3;Great; It's one of the most unusual, politically charged, and thought-provoking video games since Metal Gear Solid.;
Coded Arms Review;6.6;Fair; The first-person shooter genre may have a bright future on the PSP, but Coded Arms isn't it.;
Conflict: Desert Storm Review;5.2;Mediocre; Conflict: Desert Storm suffers from poor presentation and tedious gameplay.;
Mega Man Battle Network 5: Team Colonel Review;7.1;Good; Mega Man Battle Network 5 improves on the previous game, but it also rehashes the same basic design, graphics, and audio that have been with the series since its inception.;
Madagascar Review;4;Poor; Madagascar for the GBA is an uninspired, cookie-cutter platformer that would be perfect for kids if it weren't so ugly.;
Mega Man Battle Network 5: Team Protoman Review;7.1;Good; Mega Man Battle Network 5 improves on the previous game, but it also rehashes the same basic design, graphics, and audio that have been with the series since its inception.;
King of Fighters: Maximum Impact - Maniax Review;7;Good; It's mostly suited for card-carrying King of Fighters fans, though the addition of solid online play makes the Xbox version of the game considerably more appealing than the PS2 original.;
RollerCoaster Tycoon 3: Soaked! Review;8.1;Great; This expansion for RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 adds a ton of cool new content and addresses many of the issues from that game.;
Atelier Iris: Eternal Mana Review;7.2;Good; With its simple, turn-based battles, storybook universe, and saccharine characters, Atelier Iris: Eternal Mana feels like a throwback to the glory days of the SNES role-playing games.;
Evel Knievel Evel-ution 3D Review;6.1;Fair; Evel Knievel Evel-ution 3D doesn't look good or play well enough to justify its premium price.;
Fantastic 4 Review;5.8;Mediocre; Fantastic 4 suffers from imprecise controls, a lackluster presentation, a few bugs, and other issues that make it difficult to recommend.;
Herbie: Fully Loaded Review;5;Mediocre; Herbie: Fully Loaded's 3D graphics are nice, but everything else is underdeveloped and poorly programmed.;
Something Fishy Review;7.6;Good; Darwin's mobile game of choice is both ridiculous and totally entertaining.;
Fantastic 4 Review;5.8;Mediocre; Fantastic 4 suffers from imprecise controls, a lackluster presentation, a few bugs, and other issues that make it difficult to recommend.;
Top Spin Tennis Review;6.5;Fair; Top Spin Tennis makes great strides in the simulation of shot selection, but its automation of player movement negates this progress.;
AstroPop Review;8.5;Great; AstroPop is a game that should appeal to virtually every mobile gamer out there.;
Batman Begins Review;5;Mediocre; You'll get everything and more out of watching the movie that you could from playing the game...in the same amount of time.;
Yu-Gi-Oh! Online Review;5.8;Mediocre; Yu-Gi-Oh! Online does just enough to please the devoted Yu-Gi-Oh! fans that are already out there, but not much more.;
Ford Mustang: The Legend Lives Review;4.4;Poor;" Affordably priced, the venerated Ford Mustang's latest namesake game otherwise misfires all the way down the track--suffering from sloppy physics, plodding navigation, dated graphics, and an uninspiring ""career"" mode.";
Fishtank Frenzy Review;5;Mediocre; Fishtank Frenzy just isn't enjoyable enough to sustain your interest for more than a few minutes. It's therefore a bad value and probably not a game you'll want to buy.;
Callaway Golf Review;5.1;Mediocre; You aren't going to shave strokes off your short game as a result of playing this half-baked title.;
Finny the Fish & the Seven Waters Review;5.6;Mediocre; The exasperating moments make it hard to recommend this game for young players, and its otherwise mellow charm isn't quite enough to engage those with more sophisticated tastes.;
War of the Worlds Review;8.5;Great; Even if it's not quite perfect, War of the Worlds is a deep, beautiful game.;
Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition Review;7.3;Good; All told, it's a flawed but fun street racer, and genre enthusiasts will certainly enjoy it on some level.;
Dead to Rights: Reckoning Review;5.7;Mediocre; From the nearly useless multiplayer to the dull single-player gameplay, there's not much worth seeing here.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Tenchu: Wrath of Heaven Review;7.7;Good; While Tenchu's production values could have used a boost, particularly in the sound department, this is a very good game that will appeal to fans of the series and of ...;
Who Wants to be a Millionaire 2005 Review;5.4;Mediocre; Without the million-dollar prize offering, there's not a whole lot about Who Wants to Be a Millionaire 2005 that distinguishes it from other, faster trivia games.;
Fantastic 4 Review;5.8;Mediocre; Fantastic 4 suffers from imprecise controls, a lackluster presentation, a few bugs, and other issues that make it difficult to recommend.;
Toxic Lab Review;8.2;Great; You may have played a lot of mobile games that are similar to Toxic Lab, but not many of those can match its superb spatial riddle designs.;
Hugo: The Evil Mirror Review;6.1;Fair; Hugo: The Evil Mirror is a platform-style puzzler that's clearly aimed toward a young audience.;
Fantastic 4 Review;5.8;Mediocre; Fantastic 4 suffers from imprecise controls, a lackluster presentation, a few bugs, and other issues that make it difficult to recommend.;
Darts-n-Dolls Review;3.5;Bad; Darts-n-Dolls is about as much fun as you'd expect repeatedly stopping two sliders in the middle of horizontal and vertical bars to be.;
After Burner II Review;7;Good; Though After Burner II is translated fairly well, it suffers most at the hands of the control scheme, which loses a lot of value on the scaled-down mobile system.;
Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Chaos Theory Review;5.6;Mediocre; Splinter Cell for DS sounds like it's got everything you'd want out of a portable stealth game, but it lacks the fundamentals necessary to make for an entertaining experience.;
GTR FIA Racing Review;8.8;Great; Despite its blemishes, GTR is the breath of fresh air this genre so badly needed.;
Romance of the Three Kingdoms X Review;7.2;Good; Koei's 10th Romance of the Three Kingdoms game doesn't do much to mark the occasion, but it still offers the same esoteric war strategy experience that keeps dedicated fans coming ...;
Wild West Blackjack Review;5.2;Mediocre; A year or two ago, this game's presentational frippery might have served to set it apart from the competition. In 2005, it's old hat.;
Chess 2.0 Review;7;Good; The game could have benefited from a little more detail, but for what it is, Chess 2.0 does a pretty good job.;
Boiling Point: Road to Hell Review;7;Good; Boiling Point works off the Grand Theft Auto template to fashion an open-ended hybrid shooter with more diverse missions than the genre has seen in years.;
Virtual Pool: Tournament Edition Review;6.4;Fair; This certainly isn't a bad game of pool, but it lives up to few expectations beyond what its meager price tag would suggest.;
Tankracer Review;7.2;Good; Everyone knows army tanks are synonymous with wacky fun, and this game is a further example of that truth.;
Gumball 3000 Review;8;Great; Gumball 3000 is a breath of fresh exhaust in a download section populated by street- racing also-rans.;
Bewitched Review;5.8;Mediocre; The most interesting aspect of Bewitched is the trivia, and after a few rounds, you've already seen most of the questions.;
In the Groove Review;7.2;Good; If you're already a fan of Dance Dance Revolution and you're looking for some more steps and tracks for your PlayStation 2, In the Groove is a good addition to ...;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Zoo Tycoon 2 Review;7.8;Good; Zoo Tycoon 2 is an impressive feat that trumps most other mobile games of its type.;
Derek Jeter Pro Baseball Review;8.7;Great; Derek Jeter Pro Baseball is so far beyond its competition as to render it largely irrelevant.;
Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2005 Review;7.6;Good; Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2005 fixes the previous edition's most egregious problems, and it's therefore more than just an incremental update.;
Meteos Review;8.5;Great; One of the best DS games yet, Meteos delivers a unique and successful twist on the puzzle game formula.;
Outlaw Volleyball Remixed Review;5.8;Mediocre; The most frustrating thing about Outlaw Volleyball Remixed is that, were it not for the stupid posturing and the fact that it's a clunky port of a 2-year-old title, it's ...;
Destroy All Humans! Review;7.5;Good; Destroy All Humans! shows such enthusiasm for its thematic inspiration that you can't help but at least appreciate what it tries to do.;
Destroy All Humans! Review;7.5;Good; Destroy All Humans! shows such enthusiasm for its thematic inspiration that you can't help but at least appreciate what it tries to do.;
ER Review;5.2;Mediocre; ER's assembly-line approach to the process of saving lives and its utter lack of any meaningful or dramatic storytelling rob it of the two things the TV show is most ...;
Pac-Man Review;7.1;Good; Almost all the best aspects of the game are solidly translated to this very portable format.;
Bomberman Review;7.8;Good; If you're a Bomberman fan, you already know exactly what to expect, but this is also a good game for anyone yet to be acquainted with Hudson's long-running series.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Arc the Lad: End of Darkness Review;5.3;Mediocre; End of Darkness is mindless and repetitive, and the online multiplayer does nothing to mitigate the weak single-player campaign, lifeless characters, and dull presentation of the game.;
Mouse Puzzle review;6.4;Fair; There isn't enough content or variety in this game to make it worthwhile.;
Banjo-Kazooie: Grunty's Revenge Missions Review;5.6;Mediocre; Banjo-Kazooie Missions is a disappointingly simple game with a minimal relationship to the license.;
Kid Warlock Review;5.6;Mediocre; For all its depth, Kid Warlock just isn't fun to play.;
Popeye Kart Racing Review;5.6;Mediocre; Popeye Kart Racing is not deep or interesting enough to recommend very strongly.;
Wimbledon 2005 Review;6.9;Fair; Control remains the final frontier for wireless gaming, and it's a tough issue for developers to contend with. At its core, Wimbledon 2005 is a decent tennis game that doesn't ...;
Battlefield 2 Review;9.3;Superb; Despite the fact that it's a sequel, Battlefield 2 is a thrilling action game that immerses you in the chaos of combat like never before.;
Psychonauts Review;8.7;Great; Psychonauts holds up to the challenge of being a platformer on the PS2 by delivering an experience that ranks right up there with the best the system has to offer.;
Connect Four Challenge Review;7.5;Good; Connect Four Challenge proves that a mobile game doesn't need to do something entirely different to be worthwhile.;
Fate Review;7.9;Good; It's a fully 3D action RPG that's like a combination of Diablo and its sequel, but with better graphics.;
Ivan Ironman Stewart's Off-Road Racing 3D Review;5;Mediocre; Responsive control and fast action are the most important factors in any racing game, and they're not present here.;
Conker: Live and Reloaded Review;8.3;Great; Conker: Live & Reloaded definitely has some quirks, and even a few legitimate problems, but the whole of the experience is a great one. Xbox owners would do well to ...;
Capone Casino Review;5.7;Mediocre; The developer would have better served gamers by offering fewer games of a higher quality.;
Impossible Mission Review;7.7;Good; While it's not the most readily accessible game, Impossible Mission is poised to delight a new generation of gamers.;
Brunswick Billiards Challenge Review;7.4;Good; This is a solid game of pool designed with the simulation crowd in mind.;
Star Wars Trivia Review;6.9;Fair; In its current state, Star Wars Trivia just isn't long enough.;
WWE Aftershock Review;5.3;Mediocre; Even as a mindless button-masher, WWE Aftershock isn't particularly successful.;
Stargate SG-1 Review;6.9;Fair; The action is not the strongest, but the Stargate SG-1 atmosphere will be a big draw for the series' enthusiasts.;
Capcom Fighting Evolution Review;6.5;Fair; It's clearly best suited for hardcore fans of Capcom's fighting games, who might enjoy exploring some of the nuances here, but probably won't find much reason to keep coming back.;
Fantastic Four Review;7.3;Good; Fantastic 4's unique visual style and great use of the original license makes it worth playing, even if the gameplay is a little sloppy.;
The Chronicles of Riddick Review;7;Good; The mobile Chronicles of Riddick is a good action adventure game in its own right, but perhaps it suffers a bit from the high standards Escape From Butcher Bay has ...;
GoldenEye: Rogue Agent Review;6.3;Fair; While it's sort of impressive on some level that the DS can deliver an experience similar to the console version, the experience it's based on wasn't any fun to begin ...;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Batman Begins Review;6.8;Fair; While Batman Begins is still worthwhile for Batman fans, the gameplay feels too much like a mishmash of several other well-known gaming franchises and ends up overly simplistic.;
Batman Begins Review;6.7;Fair; While Batman Begins is still worthwhile for Batman fans, the gameplay feels too much like a mishmash of several other well-known gaming franchises and ends up overly simplistic.;
Batman Begins Review;6.8;Fair; While Batman Begins is still worthwhile for Batman fans, the gameplay feels too much like a mishmash of several other well-known gaming franchises and ends up overly simplistic.;
Alien Hominid Review;7.4;Good; To call this collection of simple Java minigames a port would be a little flattering. It does a nice job with the material as long as it lasts, though.;
Slyder Review;7.3;Good; You'll likely enjoy your time with Slyder, unless you've played many other games like it.;
Hollywood Squares Review;7.9;Good; Hollywood Squares may not have the same value as its TV counterpart, but it's an amazingly well-polished and thoughtful trivia game.;
Restricted Area Review;6.7;Fair; It's a fairly simple and repetitive action RPG, yet it's not without a certain homegrown charm that should appeal to fans of the genre who don't expect too much.;
Blackjack Pro / Video Poker Pro Review;7.1;Good; This two-in-one casino game sports a very professional look and many options, which may help you forget about its lack of connectivity and detailed instructions.;
The Crocodile Hunter: Operation Rescue Review;7.4;Good; Operation Rescue's tight design and silly concept make it an excellent play.;
Juiced Review;6.3;Fair; There is nothing exceptionally bad about Juiced's design, nor is there anything laudable about it.;
Puyo Pop Fever Review;7.3;Good; If you can tolerate the forcibly cute presentation, you'll find Puyo Pop Fever to be a solid, addictive puzzle game.;
Juiced Review;6.1;Fair; There is nothing exceptionally bad about Juiced's design, nor is there anything laudable about it.;
Mr. & Mrs. Smith Review;6.8;Fair; This shooting-gallery game's design works well and is engaging, but it isn't backed up with enough content to be anything more than a quick novelty.;
Pocket Aquarium Review;2.9;Terrible; Pocket Aquarium probably shouldn't be in Verizon's games section, but it is. Even as a screensaver, though, this would be a poor offering.;
Thief: Deadly Shadows Episode 1 Review;7.8;Good; Taken as a 2D platformer, this is a diverting little adventure, which is more varied than Iomo's Tomb Raider trilogy, but--fittingly for Garrett--very much in the shadow of the Splinter ...;
Name That Tune! Review;7.7;Good; Not only is Name That Tune! fun, it's a really good idea, too.;
Max Trigger: Insurgence Review;6;Fair; Max Trigger is essentially an action game without a lot of action.;
Kirby: Canvas Curse Review;8.6;Great; Canvas Curse couldn't really be done on any other platform, yet it doesn't sacrifice its gameplay for the sake of short-lived gimmicks.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Card Sharks Review;6.7;Fair; Card Sharks is fun for a short while, and it does an acceptable job of capturing the atmosphere of the show--but that doesn't mean it makes for a compelling mobile ...;
3D Field Golf Review;3.9;Bad; When a golf game is crippled by technological failures, you must get a sense as to the extreme severity of those shortcomings.;
Juiced Review;6.3;Fair; There is nothing exceptionally bad about Juiced's design, nor is there anything laudable about it.;
Samurai Western Review;5.3;Mediocre; The fast-paced combat can be entertaining, but its appeal is severely weighed down by the ridiculous amount of repetition in the battles, environments, and enemies and by the brain-dead opponent ...;
Area 51 Review;6.9;Fair; For shooter fans in serious need of something new to play, Area 51 fits the bill adequately. But for anyone looking for something more than an average shooter, it probably ...;
Madagascar Review;7;Good; Madagascar is a short but endearing adventure that will be immediately appealing to the adolescent gamers in your household, whether or not they've seen the movie.;
Boggle Review;7.5;Good; If you're playing alone, Boggle is a great game on the mobile platform.;
Swerve Basketball Review;6.7;Fair; Swerve Basketball is a passable game of hoops, but its slow-moving gameplay is too limited for lasting enjoyment.;
Yoshi Topsy-Turvy Review;6.6;Fair; Yoshi Topsy-Turvy isn't a bad game by any means;
Ancient Empires II Review;8.5;Great; The logistics become incredibly complex, but they also become utterly compelling. Each move must be pored over for several minutes, with the implications spreading out across the landscape like wildfire.;
Madagascar Review;7;Good; Madagascar is a short but endearing adventure that will be immediately appealing to the adolescent gamers in your household, whether or not they've seen the movie.;
Jewel Quest Review;6.5;Fair; If you've played an Elimimatch game before, there's no reason to try Jewel Quest.;
Madagascar Review;7;Good; Madagascar is a short but endearing adventure that will be immediately appealing to the adolescent gamers in your household, whether or not they've seen the movie.;
Medal of Honor: European Assault Review;7.6;Good; The game's wide-open levels actually encourage players to explore, giving the series a fresh feel compared to past games. Unfortunately, a very brief campaign and no online multiplayer means the ...;
Elektra Review;6.2;Fair; Unless you're a fan of the Elektra continuum, there's no reason to choose this game over similar and superior offerings.;
Supreme Ruler 2010 Review;7.6;Good; Complexity and accessibility are rarely so well-balanced in a strategy game.;
The Longest Yard Review;7.5;Good; If you're a fan of the movie, this above-average football game may tickle your fancy.;
Extreme Air Snowboarding 3D Review;6.5;Fair; Extreme Air Snowboarding can't quite be called a tech demo, but its gameplay isn't much deeper than that.;
Crazy Eights Review;6.1;Fair; It delivers exactly as advertised, with the good old-fashioned card game of Crazy Eights.;
Medal of Honor: European Assault Review;7.6;Good; The game's wide-open levels actually encourage players to explore, giving the series a fresh feel compared to past games. Unfortunately, a very brief campaign and no online multiplayer means the ...;

Delta Force: Xtreme Review;7.2;Good; If you're a shooter fan on a budget, Delta Force Xtreme isn't a bad way to go.;
Knights of Honor Review;8;Great; While not for everyone, Knights of Honor is an original, enjoyable, and deep strategy game about the Middle Ages.;
Yahtzee Deluxe Review;7.8;Good; Once you play Yahtzee Deluxe, you might not find the need to go back to the original version of the game ever again.;
Terminator: I'm Back Review;7.1;Good; On the battlefield, one hopes one's comrades-at-arms aren't purely decorative. This average game could have been so much better.;
Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Review;9.2;Superb; Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is a stupendous thrill ride that shouldn't be missed.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Still Life Review;6.7;Fair; Its slavish dedication to convention will scratch the methodical, cerebral itch all diehard adventure game fans have.;
X-Plane 8 Review;7.9;Good; X-Plane is a fantastic sandbox that makes a terrific counterpart to the much more rigid Flight Simulator series.;
Still Life Review;6.7;Fair; Its slavish dedication to convention will scratch the methodical, cerebral itch all diehard adventure game fans have.;
Pac-Man Pinball Review;4.5;Poor; Pac-Man Pinball fails to provide the one thing a virtual pinball game must: accurate ball physics.;
Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Review;9;Superb; Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is a stupendous thrill ride that shouldn't be missed.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Operation Review;5.7;Mediocre; You're better off leaving your pleasant memories of Operation alone, rather than tainting them by playing this game.;
Pinball Hall of Fame Review;7.2;Good; Pinball Hall of Fame looks good, controls well, and should be a no-brainer as an addition to your library if you're a fan of simulated pinball.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
MVP Baseball Review;7.7;Good; MVP Baseball for the PSP is both rough around the edges and missing some of the features that made the console versions so appealing. But it's still tops in terms ...;
Double Dragon EX Review;7.8;Good; Although it's still too short, Double Dragon EX delivers the excellent gameplay that fans of the series have come to expect.;
Strike Force Bowling Review;5.2;Mediocre; Strike Force Bowling attempts to combine zany locales with tried-and-true bowling  mechanics, but the game lacks substance and ultimately won't please bowling fans, be they hardcore or casual.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones Review;8.8;Great; It offers a lengthy, rewarding, thought-provoking experience that truly makes you feel as though the decisions you make, waging one exciting battle after the next, carry serious consequences.;
Special Forces: Nemesis Strike Review;5;Mediocre; It's a trite and aggressively boring version of what a million other third-person action games have done. And even for its budget price, it's a pretty lousy value.;
Special Forces: Nemesis Strike Review;5;Mediocre; It's a trite and aggressively boring version of what a million other third-person action games have done. And even for its budget price, it's a pretty lousy value.;
Imperial Glory Review;6.7;Fair; Imperial Glory is a good Total War clone that packs a lot of unfulfilled potential.;
Need for Speed Underground 2 Review;7.2;Good; There's enough variety here to keep you busy;
Pac-Man Pinball Advance Review;3.4;Bad; Rushed, broken, and ugly are appropriate words to use when describing Pac-Man Pinball Advance.;
Daily Puzzle Review;7.9;Good; If you're not satisfied with the degree to which your daily life puzzles you, there's finally a solution beyond your local paper's word jumble.;
Pac-Mania 3D Review;5.6;Mediocre;" The ""3D"" designation shouldn't fool anyone. This is the same game to which you were indifferent in the late '80s.";
Batman Begins Review;8.5;Great; Not only is Batman Begins a great Batman game, but it's a great game in general.;
Super Adventure Island Review;8.3;Great; Well designed and eminently playable, Super Adventure Island is one of the best platformers on mobile.;
Advent Rising Review;5.7;Mediocre; The presentation is a technical nightmare, the story is poorly told, and the modicum of uniqueness the gameplay has to offer is almost completely murdered by sloppy mechanics and a ...;
Star Wars Galaxies: Episode III Rage of the Wookiees Review;7.3;Good; Star Wars Galaxies is in the best shape of its life right now, thanks in no small part to the recently released Episode III Rage of the Wookiees expansion.;
Stolen review;5.3;Mediocre; Stolen feels like a budget title being sold at full price, and with so many good stealth games already available, there's simply no reason to play this one.;
Stolen Review;5;Mediocre; Stolen feels like a budget title being sold at full price, and with so many good stealth games already available, there's simply no reason to play this one.;
Dungeon Lords Review;6.8;Fair; Unfortunately, a slew of noticeably missing features and other problems may well end up drawing too much of your attention away from the game's good parts.;
Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith Review;7.3;Good; The 3D levels and the multiplayer mode built around them easily justify the $10 premium that the DS game carries over the GBA game.;
Metal Slug 4 & 5 Review;7.5;Good; It's likely that only those players who have already acquired a taste for Metal Slug's rich blend of crazy, manic violence and goofy humor will fully appreciate this package.;
Cold Winter Review;7.5;Good; Cold Winter isn't the best in its class, but it's definitely worth playing if you're looking for a solid single-player shooter with a decent online component to back it up.;
Popeye: Rush for Spinach Review;4.2;Poor; Popeye: Rush for Spinach is an unsuccessful attempt to combine racing and platforming together into a single game.;
Haunting Ground Review;7.2;Good; Haunting Ground delivers creepy moments aplenty, but some gameplay oddness and AI quirks mar the adventure.;
Smart Bomb Review;4.8;Poor; Smart Bomb has an interesting premise, but it absolutely fails to capitalize on that premise.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Running of the Bulls Review;7.3;Good; Running of the Bulls is an enjoyable game, even though it would have benefited from a little more variety.;
Kentucky Derby Championship Racing Review;7;Good; All told, Kentucky Derby Championship Racing's great core gameplay bolsters a lackluster presentation. Given the rarity of this type of game on mobile, horse-racing fans should definitely give Kentucky Derby ...;
Yohoho! Puzzle Pirates Review;8.1;Great; If you like the idea of competitive and cooperative puzzling online, Puzzle Pirates may be just what you're looking for.;
Star Trek: The Cold Enemy Review;8;Great; This game's maddeningly clever level designs, combined with its unusually smooth animation, will keep action fans sweating--whether they're fans of the old show or not.;
WarioWare: Twisted! Review;8.8;Great; WarioWare: Twisted! is a great game that any Nintendo portable owner can enjoy.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Constantine Review;6.8;Fair; In spite of everything it has going for it, Constantine isn't much fun to play.;
Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith Review;7;Good; A solid Star Wars-themed beat-'em-up that's repetitive and a little too brief, but fun while it lasts.;
Motocross Mania 3 Review;3.1;Bad; There's not enough fun in Motocross Mania 3 to even justify its bargain bin price.;
Dangerous Waters Review;8.3;Great; There's enough in Dangerous Waters to keep even the most demanding naval sim fan happy for years.;
Dead Celebrity Poker Review;6.5;Fair; This game really piles on the novelties, but in the end, neither bantering phantoms nor online play can distract from the fact that the poker engine itself isn't so great.;
Stolen Review;5;Mediocre; Stolen feels like a budget title being sold at full price, and with so many good stealth games already available, there's simply no reason to play this one.;
Sega Home Run King 2 Review;5.1;Mediocre; Home Run King 2 isn't recommendable, simply because it fails to deliver a decent batting experience. Elements of the game's presentation are excellent, but they lack a foundation of good ...;
TrackMania Sunrise Review;8.2;Great; Sunrise is, in most every way, exactly what you would want from a sequel to the original TrackMania.;
Master of Sword Review;8.7;Great; Not only is Master of Sword enjoyable, but it's also one of the longest mobile games around.;
Chris Moneymaker's World Poker Championship Review;3.8;Bad; Stick to the free, online poker wherever you can get it, and leave Chris Moneymaker's World Poker Championship on the shelf.;
Hot Shots Golf: Open Tee Review;7.8;Good; Open Tee capably translates the Hot Shots look and feel to the PSP, making it an accessible and entertaining golf game.;
Donkey Konga 2 Review;6.9;Fair; The drumming action itself is still responsive and entertaining, but the whole package simply doesn't feel as inspired as the original, and it makes little effort to expand or improve ...;
Stella Deus: The Gate of Eternity Review;7.5;Good; Stella Deus doesn't set out to redefine its genre, but instead simply provides a good game of its type.;
Mean Girls Wannabee Review;4.2;Poor; Mean Girls Wannabe is the worst kind of mobile cash-in.;
Pokemon Emerald Review;7.5;Good; Despite being made mostly of recycled parts, Emerald proves that the PokÌ©mon formula still works. As a result, the game remains an enjoyably light RPG experience.;
Muscle Car Mayhem Review;5.8;Mediocre; Muscle Car Mayhem is packed full of classic muscle cars, but it's sorely lacking any mayhem.;
Beach Mini Golf 3D Review;7.6;Good; Beach Mini Golf 3D offers nine unique holes, each made more interesting by the use of the third dimension. It by no means reinvents the wheel, but it's an easygoing ...;

Guild Wars Review;9.2;Superb; It's a very impressive game that's rewarding on many different levels and can be tremendously appealing for any number of reasons.;

Destroy All Humans! Review;6.5;Fair; This game is basically a competent action adventure romp, despite its problems.;

Forza Motorsport Review;9.2;Superb; Forza Motorsport is a stylish and challenging game that is easily one of the best racers on the Xbox.;
Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Jungle Storm Review;8.1;Great; This is probably the first downloadable mobile FPS that's worth playing.;
Predator: Concrete Jungle Review;5.3;Mediocre; There was certainly good stealth-action potential in the Predator license, but Concrete Jungle all but completely wastes it.;
Pac-Pix Review;6.9;Fair; The core idea is very cool and unlike anything else on the market. Unfortunately, the game wrapped around that idea isn't nearly as inventive.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: Vogon Planet Destructor Review;7.2;Good; The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: Vogon Planet Destructor was hardly inspired by its namesake book or film. This is a by-the-numbers shooter with decent, if hackneyed, gameplay that will ...;

Gunslinger Review;6;Fair; Gunslinger is mildly entertaining, though the bizarre feel and bare-bones style of the game really get in the way.;
Stronghold 2 Review;5.9;Mediocre; While there have been plenty of additions made to Stronghold 2 over its predecessor, a poor story, weak artificial intelligence, and plenty of bugs mar what otherwise could have been ...;

Spider-Man 2 3D: New York Subway Review;4.4;Poor; Even if you're a passionate fan of the film or comic, you still won't enjoy this joyless hodgepodge of minigames. At $10, NY Subway is a horrible value, as well ...;

World Poker Tour: Texas Hold 'Em Review;7.8;Good; If you're a fan of poker and want to play it on your cell phone, then World Poker Tour is a fine choice.;

Resident Evil Outbreak File #2 Review;6.6;Fair; Outbreak was an interesting experiment a year ago, but dealing with the archaic gameplay conventions of File #2 today feels a little like taking a step backward.;

Kuon Review;6.3;Fair; Kuon is inhibited by ponderous combat controls, its repetitious nature, and an overall lack of depth.;

It's Mr. Pants Review;6.6;Fair; Despite its charming crayon-inspired artwork, the barnyard sounds, and an odd fixation with underpants, It's Mr. Pants is just an average puzzle game.;
Major League Baseball 2K5 Review;8.4;Great; MLB2K5 is a flashy and comprehensive baseball sim chock-full of online options, but unfortunately it also shipped with a few noticeable bugs.;
Zuma Review;8.2;Great; On mobile, Zuma retains all the challenge and addictiveness that has made it one of PopCap's most popular games.;

Vendetta Online Review;7.1;Good; Vendetta Online's modest production budget is sometimes unkindly evident, yet it offers a reasonably effective mix of space-based trading and multiplayer combat.;
Dai Senryaku VII: Modern Military Tactics Review;8;Great; This is a complex, complicated turn-based wargame featuring literally hundreds of authentic modern military units, as well as a big campaign, dozens of stand-alone scenarios, and a budget price.;

Second Sight Review;7.3;Good; Despite a few rough patches, Second Sight ought to be an entertaining and unique ride for just about any action fan.;

Ace Combat Advance Review;5.6;Mediocre; This portable shoot-'em-up is playable and at times fun, but it's missing everything that made the console Ace Combat games so likable.;
Xenosaga Episode II: Jenseits von Gut und Bose Review;7.8;Good; Xenosaga Episode II: Jenseits von Gut und Bose isn't wholly on par with the original, but it retains a rich narrative and a lot of soul.;

Simon Review;6.2;Fair; Simon still has a place--it's just probably on a car keychain, rather than a cell phone.;
Son of the Mask Review;7.2;Good; It's all fairly routine, with the notable (and welcome) exception of multiple screen orientations, which may not improve the gameplay much but are still a fantastic novelty.;
Kingdom Hearts Review;6.2;Fair; This is a brief action game with awkward controls that manages to channel only a little of the Kingdom Hearts magic.;
Root Beer Tapper Review;7.5;Good; This is about as good a version of Tapper as one could expect on a modern cell phone.;

Yahoo! Solitaire Review;6.9;Fair; While there are better solitaire games out there, this one will adequately serve your needs.;
Buffy the Vampire Slayer Review;7.2;Good; Buffy the Vampire Slayer is a competent platformer that doesn't deviate from genre conventions in any meaningful way.;

Fritz 8 Deluxe Review;7.8;Good; Fritz 8 Deluxe is easily the best chess program for the seasoned chess player.;
True Crime Review;4.3;Poor; Although it attempts to piggyback the popularity of the console series, the only true crime here is that this game costs money.;

Ms. Pac-Man for Prizes Review;7.7;Good; If you like a good, old-fashioned game of Pac-Man and think you're pretty good at it, then Ms. Pac-Man for Prizes might be the most rewarding game you've come across ...;

Aqua Teen Hunger Force Destruct-O-Thon Review;4.2;Poor; This is not a good game, nor a good use of the Aqua Teen brand, and you should not play it.;
American Chopper Review;5.2;Mediocre; It's a classic example of a game that appears to have little purpose other than cashing in on a hot license.;

Axis & Allies Review;6;Fair; Incompetent artificial intelligence and some weak gameplay mechanics hamper what could have been an interesting real-time strategy take on the popular board game.;
Sega SuperStars Review;7.3;Good; The healthy number of minigames included in the package makes it one of best values out there for EyeToy owners.;
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2 Review;7.5;Good; The GBA version of TMNT2: Battle Nexus is a good puzzle-oriented adventure game that's peppered with stealth sections, boss fights, and shooter levels.;
The Incredibles Review;6.1;Fair; The Incredibles is a fairly unremarkable experience that puts you through the motions of the film's plot without capturing any of its essence.;
The Incredibles Review;6.1;Fair; The Incredibles is a fairly unremarkable experience that puts you through the motions of the film's plot without capturing any of its essence.;
The Incredibles Review;6.1;Fair; The Incredibles is a fairly unremarkable experience that puts you through the motions of the film's plot without capturing any of its essence.;
Ducati Extreme Review;8.3;Great; Simply put, Ducati Extreme is one of the most enjoyable racers to grace the Series 60 platform.;
ATV Offroad Fury 3 Review;7.5;Good; ATV Offroad Fury 3, maintains a familiar feel while generally tightening up the whole package.;
Guilty Gear Isuka Review;6.1;Fair; While many fighting games this year have gone online, Guilty Gear Isuka takes a step back and to the side with its awkward multicharacter fighting system.;
Deer Hunter Review;8.6;Great; Deer Hunter is a marvelous interpretation of the original game that conforms surprisingly well to the mobile platform.;
Sonic Mega Collection Plus Review;7.5;Good; While Sonic aficionados will be disappointed by the omission of a few notable titles, there's a ton of solid Robotnik-thwarting to be had with the Mega Collection Plus.;
FIFA Soccer 2005 Review;8.9;Great; This is EA Sports' best soccer game to date on the pitch, but it's really unfortunate that the career mode isn't more user-friendly.;

Star Wars Galaxies: Jump to Lightspeed Review;7.6;Good; Jump to Lightspeed has been designed to reward dedicated SWG players rather than appeal to new ones, and that's exactly what it does.;
Sonic Mega Collection Plus Review;7.5;Good; While Sonic aficionados will be disappointed by the omission of a few notable titles, there's a ton of solid Robotnik-thwarting to be had with the Mega Collection Plus.;
Men of Valor Review;7.9;Good; Men of Valor is a first-person shooter set in the Vietnam War. And it's good!;
RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 Review;7.8;Good; If not for some of the glaring bugs in the retail version, RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 would have been a truly excellent sequel to a beloved franchise.;
Robocop Review;7.8;Good; Fans of arcade games, and especially of the original arcade title, will enjoy Robocop.;
Classic NES Series: Castlevania Review;7.4;Good; It's rare that you find a game as old as this one that still manages to provide you with an entertaining experience from beginning to end, but Castlevania definitely does.;
Taiko Drum Master Review;7.3;Good; Taiko Drum Master might be best rented for parties and suchlike given its bundled-with-a-peripheral price tag and somewhat limited single-player appeal.;
Armored Core: Nexus Review;7.7;Good; Nexus doesn't look, sound, or handle any differently from previous Armored Core games, but it sure does offer a lot more in terms of customization and challenge.;
Pacific Fighters Review;7.3;Good; This is the best way to get your Pacific theater air combat fix, but it unfortunately marks the low point in the series.;
The Nightmare of Druaga Review;5.7;Mediocre; The Nightmare of Druaga is a dungeon hack of the most boring kind.;
OutRun2 Review;8.3;Great; While it may not offer the sophistication of other racing games on the market, OutRun2 has an old-school sensibility that makes it both appealing and addictive.;
Hidden & Dangerous 2: Sabre Squadron Review;7.3;Good; The real draw of Sabre Squadron's offerings is the chance to play its new missions cooperatively.;
Outlaw Golf 2 Review;7.5;Good; Outlaw Golf 2 offers a tight, challenging game of golf with some unique gameplay ideas, and it comes at a price that makes it a terrific value.;

Ace Combat 5: The Unsung War Review;8.3;Great; Ace Combat 5 isn't the huge step for the series that Ace Combat 04 was, but it's still a great flight combat game, featuring grueling arcade-style action and plenty of ...;
Scaler Review;6.6;Fair; Scaler just isn't an especially engaging platformer, so it's unlikely that anyone past the youngest of audiences will get too much fun from it.;
The Bard's Tale Review;6.7;Fair; The Bard's Tale is a decent dungeon crawler that invests some energy into lampooning role-playing games and high fantasy in general.;
Dead or Alive Ultimate Review;8.8;Great;" For a game that's so bold as to call itself ""Ultimate,"" DOAU sure comes close. It truly is the best, most fully featured Dead or Alive fighting game yet.";

Grand Theft Auto Advance Review;6.5;Fair; There's some nostalgic gameplay here, but by and large GTA Advance just isn't much fun.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Ape Escape: Pumped & Primed Review;6.4;Fair; As a party game, Pumped & Primed is nice insomuch that it should be easy for even your nongamer friends to pick up. However, its appeal is limited.;
Atlantis Evolution Review;4.9;Poor; If you can bear playing Atlantis Evolution long enough, it starts to get better toward the end, but by then it's scant consolation.;
Tak 2: The Staff of Dreams Review;6.7;Fair; The Staff of Dreams is definitely a more well-conceived game than The Power of Juju, but the whole experience is muddled by an inconsistent difficulty and slapdash level designs.;

SuperPower 2 Review;5.2;Mediocre; All SuperPower 2 has going for it is an anything-can-happen atmosphere.;
National Treasure Review;4;Poor; Unless you are obsessed with all things Nic Cage, there's absolutely no reason to buy this game.;

Boktai 2: Solar Boy Django Review;8;Great; Boktai 2 stands as a unique action adventure experience that's sufficiently different from the first game to make it seem fresh and interesting all over again.;
Trigger Man Review;4.2;Poor; Trigger Man is short and clumsy, and not particularly pleasant to look at either.;
Yager Review;6.7;Fair; Yager is priced to move, and fans of aerial dogfighting games will find 15 to 20 hours of better-than-average action here.;
Colin McRae Rally 2005 Review;6;Fair; While there's some fun to be had with Colin McRae and pals, the gameplay is far too finicky to be comfortably enjoyed with a digital keypad.;
Trigger Man Review;4.2;Poor; Trigger Man is short and clumsy, and not particularly pleasant to look at either.;
Dark Fall: Lights Out Review;6.3;Fair; If you played last year's Dark Fall - The Journal, then you've virtually played its follow-up, Dark Fall: Lights Out. Both games share almost identical weaknesses and strengths.;

Jamdat Sports NBA 2005 Review;7.8;Good; It's not the deepest game you'll ever play on your mobile phone, but if you're a basketball fan it should easily keep you occupied for a few minutes at a ...;

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2: Battle Nexus Review;4.6;Poor; Battle Nexus is more than just a step backward for this series--it's a step backward into a large chasm.;
OP15: Rising Threat Review;7.8;Good; OP15: Rising Threat is definitely missing a few pieces when it comes to user accessibility, but those who invest some time in this game will be rewarded.;
Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 2: Bush Rescue Review;7;Good; Older audiences probably won't be engaged by it, but Ty 2 should be easily appreciated by juvenile platformer fans.;

Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 2: Bush Rescue Review;7;Good; Older audiences probably won't be engaged by it, but Ty 2 should be easily appreciated by juvenile platformer fans.;
Baldur's Gate Review;7.9;Good; Sorrent's Baldur's Gate is a very good game that proves moble can cater to more than just a casual audience.;
Kingdom Under Fire: The Crusaders Review;8.5;Great; Once you climb The Crusaders' steep learning curve and experience the wild frenzy of its massive battles, all the game's complexity pays off in spades.;
Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 2: Bush Rescue Review;7;Good; Older audiences probably won't be engaged by it, but Ty 2 should be easily appreciated by juvenile platformer fans.;
Final Fantasy XI Chains of Promathia Review;6.8;Fair; It's designed exclusively for Final Fantasy XI's most dedicated players, and probably should have been a downloadable update for those players.;

Ms. Pac-Man Maze Madness Review;6.5;Fair; Maze Madness adds puzzle-solving to the classic Pac-Man formula, but the lack of difficulty makes it best suited for inexperienced or younger players.;
Shark Tale Review;7;Good; Shark Tale integrates a fair amount of footage, music, and dialogue from the movie it's based on, but the pleasant surprise here is the sheer variety of different levels the ...;
Tony Hawk's Underground 2 Review;8.2;Great; Thanks to the game's wide variety of tricks and terrain, there's enough skating action here to keep you busting combos for hours.;

SVC Chaos: SNK vs. Capcom Review;6.3;Fair; Not only does SVC Chaos simply not play particularly well by the standards of 2D fighting games, but also the game's implementation of Xbox Live support is flawed.;

Port Royale 2 Review;8.3;Great; Port Royale 2 might focus more on building shipping cartels than sea battles and swordplay, but its brilliantly realized design is more than just number crunching.;

Pikmin 2 Review;9.2;Superb; With Pikmin 2, Nintendo has addressed the bulk of the shortcomings of its predecessor by crafting a game that tops the original in nearly every way.;

Fatal Force Review;8;Great; Macrospace's Fatal Force rises above the pack with its surprisingly strong multiplayer.;
CS Garfield Pinball Review;6.3;Fair; The differences between this game and any other pinball title are minimal and come as a result of the Garfield license rather than from original game design.;
FlipIt! Review;7.1;Good; If you're on the hunt for a good, difficult puzzle game that will keep you busy, FlipIt!'s 50 levels will give you a lot to think about.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.

Army Men: Sarge's War Review;5.2;Mediocre; After playing through Army Men: Sarge's War, it's likely that you'll find yourself wondering why anyone bothered to salvage the Army Men license at all.;
Crash Nitro Kart Review;6.9;Fair; You can tell that there's a really good game inside Crash Nitro Kart, but it's a shame that you can't quite see it.;
Dual Threat Review;3.1;Bad; An enjoyably prototypical plot is the best thing that this short, repetitive, and poorly produced side-scrolling shooter has to offer.;

Doom 3 Review;8.5;Great; While not as remarkable as the technology that fuels it, the game itself is put together well enough to make Doom 3 legitimately great, all things considered.;
Catwoman Review;5.4;Mediocre; Only devoted fans of the character will want to take the plunge on the GBA version of Catwoman.;
Actraiser Review;3.7;Bad; The mobile manifestation of Actraiser is but a pale shadow of the classic game's former glory.;

Ice Maze Review;7.1;Good; It's a nice little time killer, and it's a fairly fun and challenging one at that.;

Movie Trivia Rave Review;6.3;Fair; Movie Trivia Rave doesn't offer enough questions to stay interesting for very long.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
SpongeBob SquarePants Bowling Review;6.7;Fair; SpongeBob Bowling combines the colorful characters of the Nickelodeon cartoon series with a game closely modeled on what makes Jamdat Bowling successful.;
Hummer Offroad Challenge Review;6.3;Fair; Aside from your occasional jump or nitro hit, Hummer Offroad Challenge is a pretty bland racer.;

Momentum Review;7.2;Good; There may not be much to Momentum's rudimentary premise, but its clever planning and multiplayer elements make for an unexpectedly engrossing experience.;
Catwoman Review;5.6;Mediocre; Catwoman attempts to deliver some Prince of Persia-like acrobatics, but it's dragged down by bad control, weak voice work, and shoddy gameplay.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Pandora Tomorrow Review;6.1;Fair; Even those who only own Nintendo's system would be selling themselves short by picking up this version of the game.;
Sudeki Review;6.5;Fair; Sudeki is, unfortunately, more style than substance.;
Puyo Pop Fever Review;7.1;Good; Puyo Pop Fever comes with a new coat of paint and a new gameplay mechanic, but at its core it's still the same old Puyo Pop.;
Catwoman Review;6.3;Fair; Catwoman attempts to deliver some Prince of Persia-like acrobatics, but its sharp graphics are offset by bad control, weak voice work, and shoddy gameplay.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.

Ancient Ruins 1: The Crypt of the King Review;4.8;Poor; With only 15 minutes of gameplay, Crypt of the King is pretty much impossible to recommend on its own.;
Sergei Fedorov Face-Off Hockey Review;5.1;Mediocre; Sergei Fedorov Face-Off Hockey is a mediocre title that has little to do with a real hockey experience, so it's unlikely to provide many with lasting enjoyment.;

Beyond the Law: The Third Wave Review;3.7;Bad; There's really no reason anyone should play Beyond the Law: The Third Wave.;
TOCA Race Driver 2: The Ultimate Racing Simulator Review;7.7;Good; It may not be quite up to the level of quality of its Xbox counterpart, but TOCA 2 is still a very good choice for PC owners on the hunt ...;
Red Dead Revolver Review;7.3;Good; Rockstar's Western-themed shooter has some great style and enough fun moments to justify the rough edges.;
Beyond Divinity Review;7.9;Good; This is a good, solid choice either for fans of Larian's last game or for anyone up for a deep computer role-playing experience.;
Red Dead Revolver Review;7.3;Good; Rockstar's Western-themed shooter has some great style and enough fun moments to justify the rough edges.;
Samurai Warriors Review;7.3;Good; The core game is still much the same as it has always been, and as such, Samurai Warriors remains a game primarily for those already enamored with the Warriors franchise.;
Puzzle Bobble Review;7.4;Good; Puzzle Bobble is a good addition to any puzzle-lover's library.;
Pop's Pipes Review;6.7;Fair; Pop's Pipes is a fun puzzle game that plays a lot deeper than it looks.;

Space Raiders Review;2.9;Terrible; Fans of modern shooters will have no use for this trite, monotonous junk, and fans of the original Space Invaders will simply be appalled at how Taito has butchered its ...;
Onimusha 3: Demon Siege Review;8.3;Great; If you're a fan of the series or just want to play an action adventure in which you can hack up tons of ugly monsters--with style--then this game is just ...;
Everest Review;3.4;Bad; There's so little to Everest, and what it does offer is dull.;
UFC: Sudden Impact Review;6;Fair; Sudden Impact is easily the most unflinchingly halfhearted effort in the series to date, and it only serves to further run the once-promising UFC name into the ground.;
Street Jam Basketball Review;3.4;Bad; Every aspect of the game suffers because there's so little to see and do.;
Hitman: Contracts Review;7.6;Good; Hitman: Contracts delivers some time-tested and sometimes highly entertaining stealth action, which any fan of the genre might as well check out.;
Hitman: Contracts Review;7.6;Good; Hitman: Contracts delivers some time-tested and sometimes highly entertaining stealth action, which any fan of the genre might as well check out.;
Hitman: Contracts Review;7.6;Good; Hitman: Contracts delivers some time-tested and sometimes highly entertaining stealth action, which any fan of the genre might as well check out.;
Breed Review;4.2;Poor; Breed makes a horrible first impression and then keeps making more bad impressions as you play.;
Manhunt Review;8.3;Great; Manhunt is an audacious game that backs up its extremely violent subject matter with solid stealth action gameplay.;
Serious Sam: Next Encounter Review;6.5;Fair; Next Encounter is able to deliver an experience that is at least a rough approximation of a Serious Sam game.;

All-Star Baseball 2005 Review;7.5;Good; The various minor improvements should give owners of All-Star Baseball 2004 a reason to upgrade and may convince fence-sitters to take the plunge this year.;
CT Special Forces Review;7;Good; Comparisons to Metal Slug aren't without merit, but CT Special Forces carves its own identity thanks to the intricacy of its levels.;
ESPN Major League Baseball Review;8.1;Great; Some aspects of ESPN Major League Baseball may look sloppy, but the game is great where it matters most.;
Pool Paradise Review;7.9;Good; Even if Pool Paradise weren't the only available pool game for the GameCube, it would still be a fantastic choice for any billiards fan.;
FaceOff Hockey 2004 Review;6.3;Fair; The developers may have designed a serious hockey simulation for the serious hockey fan, but the dated, almost DOS-like interface and absence of nifty accessories make it an acquired taste.;
Trivial Pursuit Unhinged Review;4.7;Poor;" Does Trivial Pursuit Unhinged improve upon the actual Trivial Pursuit experience? The answer is a resounding ""No.""";
War Times Review;5.3;Mediocre; War Times is a very conventional real-time strategy game that suffers from slow pacing and poor pathfinding.;
Trivial Pursuit Unhinged Review;4.7;Poor;" Does Trivial Pursuit Unhinged improve upon the actual Trivial Pursuit experience? The answer is a resounding ""No.""";
Northland Review;5.1;Mediocre; Those who are new to the series may not get past Northland's dated graphics engine or game design, which hasn't evolved with the rest of the RTS genre.;
Alias Review;6.3;Fair; The core concepts found within Alias are of a proven ilk, but the devil's in the details, as they say, and the sloppy execution of said concepts can't keep the ...;
Tournament Dreams College Basketball Review;8.9;Great; Tournament Dreams College Basketball comes as a blast of much-needed fresh air to the somewhat predictable pro-sim scene.;
Alias Review;6.3;Fair; The core concepts found within Alias are of a proven ilk, but the devil's in the details, as they say, and the sloppy execution of said concepts can't keep the ...;
The Powerpuff Girls: Bad Mojo Review;4.4;Poor; Even diehard fans will want to steer clear of this one.;
Resident Evil Outbreak Review;7.2;Good; Outbreak can be a fun experience--online and off--for diehard fans of the series, but the trite conventions and clumsy gameplay will probably turn off the average player.;
Fight Night 2004 Review;8.7;Great; Fight Night 2004 offers the most realistic control, gameplay, and graphics ever seen in a boxing game.;
WarioWare Inc.: Mega Party Game$ Review;7;Good; This GameCube update is largely the same as last year's Game Boy Advance game, right down to the GBA-quality graphics used in the minigames themselves.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Painkiller Review;8.5;Great; Painkiller is a simple first-person shooter at heart, but it's very well-put-together and does what it does exceedingly well.;
Fight Night 2004 Review;8.8;Great; Fight Night 2004 offers the most realistic control, gameplay, and graphics ever seen in a boxing game.;
Destruction Derby Arenas Review;6.2;Fair; The online mode makes this game worth a rental for fans of the genre, but there isn't enough to Arenas to make it worth the $40 retail price.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
NBA Ballers Review;8.2;Great; NBA Ballers offers a unique gameplay experience, with a high quality presentation overlaid on a solid game design.;
Scooby-Doo! Mystery Mayhem Review;5.6;Mediocre; Parents whose kids have Scooby-Doo hot on the brain from the movie can safely rent this one, or not, without worry of missing much.;
Scooby-Doo! Mystery Mayhem Review;5.6;Mediocre; Parents whose kids have Scooby-Doo hot on the brain from the movie can safely rent this one, or not, without worry of missing much.;
Sacred Review;7.6;Good; Sacred is a great-looking, generally solid action RPG that provides a few interesting gameplay innovations.;
Scooby-Doo! Mystery Mayhem Review;5.6;Mediocre; Parents whose kids have Scooby-Doo hot on the brain from the movie can safely rent this one, or not, without worry of missing much.;
NBA Ballers Review;8.3;Great; NBA Ballers offers a unique gameplay experience, with a high quality presentation overlaid on a solid game design.;
Midnight Nowhere Review;6.3;Fair; The early promise of this Russian-designed horror adventure game feels like it literally got lost in translation.;
Desert Rats vs. Afrika Korps Review;6.6;Fair; As good as the game looks, some flawed mechanics and a general lack of polish keep it from being as fun as it should be.;
Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Pandora Tomorrow Review;6.2;Fair; The game basically controls well and looks good, but it's difficult to the point of excess, and it has no lasting appeal once you get through its nine tough missions.;
Bomberman Jetters Review;6;Fair; Anyone hoping for a game of equal quality to Bomberman Generation will ultimately find Bomberman Jetters to be a bitter pill to swallow.;
kill.switch Review;6;Fair; The mechanics for ducking and getting behind cover are well done, and the premise is a good one. Unfortunately, that's all kill.switch really has going for it.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Mace Griffin Bounty Hunter Review;6.6;Fair; Despite the game's derivative nature, lack of multiplayer, and slightly dated technology, there's a fairly entertaining shooter experience to be had here.;

R-Type III: The Third Lightning Review;2.8;Terrible; R-Type III for the GBA is a terrible port of a great SNES game.;
Dead Man's Hand Review;6.6;Fair; Dead Man's Hand isn't a bad use of your $20, and for what it's worth, the PC version of this first-person shooter is substantially better than the previously released Xbox ...;
IL-2 Sturmovik: Forgotten Battles - Ace Expansion Pack Review;8.5;Great; The list of minor flaws could go on and on, but its total length is minuscule compared to the massive number of excellent additions this expansion serves up.;
Groove Fever Review;6.4;Fair; Despite its cool online options, Groove Fever struggles to fit the dance game premise onto a cell phone.;
American Idol Review;4.7;Poor; If you want a good rhythm game, look elsewhere. And if you want American Idol, just go watch the show.;
X-Files: Resist or Serve Review;7.6;Good; X-Files: Resist or Serve is one of those rare games based on a television license that successfully transitions the spirit and soul of its source material into a new medium.;
Lords of the Realm III Review;8.4;Great; Lords of the Realm III is one of the freshest, most satisfying games produced by Impressions in years, and it's a great real-time strategy game in its own right.;
Saturday Night Speedway Review;6.5;Fair; Though newcomers may well find it enjoyable, anyone who's wheeled into the Ratbag paddock before will undoubtedly feel a less-than-ecstatic sense of dÌ©jÌÊ vu all over again.;
Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life Review;8.7;Great; A Wonderful Life is a fun and potentially addictive game that, if you let it, will gladly consume any free time you choose to give it.;
Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Jungle Storm Review;6.3;Fair; Jungle Storm is a decent enough vehicle for more Ghost Recon, if that's what you're after, but the franchise is really starting to show its age at this late date.;
Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3 Review;6.9;Fair; The PS2 version of Rainbow Six 3 can still be a tense and exciting first-person shooting experience both online and off, but it loses a lot in translation from other ...;

All-Star Baseball 2005 Review;8;Great; Various improvements to an already great game should give owners of All-Star Baseball 2004 a reason to upgrade and may convince fence-sitters to take the plunge this year.;
Arkanoid Review;7.4;Good; Arkanoid is the best translation yet of Taito's excellent arcade catalog.;
Yu-Gi-Oh! The Dawn of Destiny Review;5.2;Mediocre; Aside from being the first version to hit the Xbox, there isn't a whole lot to differentiate The Dawn of Destiny from its predecessors.;
Cy Girls Review;5.1;Mediocre; Since there are literally hundreds of much better action games currently on the market, Cy Girls seems like a big waste of time.;
A Quiet Weekend in Capri Review;4.7;Poor; Capri certainly seems to be an enchanting island. It's too bad you don't get an adventure to match it.;
Counter-Strike: Condition Zero Review;6.8;Fair; Condition Zero's release is overshadowed by no fewer than three new technologically advanced, highly anticipated shooters, which all cast a harsh light on what is essentially a 6-year-old game--albeit a ...;
Far Cry Review;9.2;Superb; Far Cry isn't just a stunning technical accomplishment. It's quite possibly the best single-player first-person shooter experience for the PC since Half-Life.;
PokÌ©mon Colosseum Review;7.3;Good; Colosseum largely gives fans what they want, which is lots of real freaky-looking monsters and lots of battling.;
Final Fantasy XI Review;8;Great; If you're a Final Fantasy fan who's looking for an excuse to give online role-playing a try with this game, by all means go for it, though proceed with caution.;
CSI: Crime Scene Investigation: Dark Motives Review;6.3;Fair; Serious adventure gamers will find little use for Dark Motives, but serious fans of the CSI TV show will likely take something positive away from it.;
Jagged Alliance 2: Wildfire Review;7.2;Good; Fans of squad-level tactical strategy who are looking for a serious challenge--and can forgive the game's appearance--will find that Wildfire offers as much depth and excitement as Jagged Alliance 2.;
Worms 3D Review;7.8;Good; Worms 3D stands up as a cute, quirky little strategy game that has some excellent multiplayer capacity.;
Samurai Jack: The Shadow of Aku Review;5.2;Mediocre; The only remarkable thing about Samurai Jack is how utterly unremarkable it is, and that's certainly not a good reason to play this game.;
Onimusha Blade Warriors Review;6.6;Fair; There simply isn't enough to Blade Warriors to keep anyone interested beyond the time span of your average rental period.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
EverQuest: Gates of Discord Review;6.8;Fair; While hardcore players have naturally purchased this expansion already, its value to more-casual (let alone new) EverQuest players is very limited.;
Samurai Jack: The Shadow of Aku Review;5.2;Mediocre; The only remarkable thing about Samurai Jack is how utterly unremarkable it is, and that's certainly not a good reason to play this game.;
Syberia II Review;7.8;Good; While Syberia II isn't all that fans might have hoped for, it's still a very fine game and likely to provide you with hours of enjoyment.;
Wade Hixton's Counter Punch Review;7.8;Good; Wade Hixton's Counter Punch is as much of a loving tribute to Punch-Out!! as you will find in this day and age.;
School Tycoon Review;6.9;Fair; If you're looking for a management game that won't overwhelm you with details and spreadsheets, School Tycoon should be right up your alley.;
MLB 2005 Review;7.9;Good; MLB 2005 compares favorably to the other baseball games that are currently on the market, especially if online play or a franchise mode are the features that matter most to ...;
Nemesis of the Roman Empire Review;8;Great; Nemesis may resemble a typical real-time strategy game, but it features a clever logistics model and better-than-average AI to help it stand apart from the crowd.;
Seven Samurai 20XX Review;6.3;Fair; If you're looking for a frenetic beat-'em-up, a la Dynasty Warriors, 20XX may scratch your itch, though it's marred by stilted pacing and a wildly inconsistent frame rate.;
Friday Night 3D Pool Review;6.5;Fair; If you can't find a discounted copy of Virtual Pool 3 in the nearest discount bin, you may want to look to Friday Night 3D Pool as the next best ...;
Gangland Review;6.9;Fair; The execution of many of Gangland's different elements falls short of its lofty promise, thus leaving a game that has a lot of good ideas but is sometimes convoluted and ...;
Battlefield Vietnam Review;8.5;Great; Battlefield Vietnam packs more dramatic moments in its gameplay than most any multiplayer-focused action game in the past few years.;
Naval Ops: Commander Review;6.9;Fair; If you like some strategic meat with your shooting, Naval Ops: Commander is worth a look.;
Breakdown Review;7.6;Good; Breakdown is unable to bear the weight of its own innovation, so it's really just a pretty good action game that you can't help but feel could have been so ...;
MVP Baseball 2004 Review;8.3;Great; Don't think too much about statistics, and you'll be rewarded with enjoyable hardball that often bears a strong resemblance to the national pastime.;
MVP Baseball 2004 Review;9.1;Superb; The core fundamentals are spot-on, the variety of options and control choices is spectacular, and the presentation totally draws you into the experience.;
Mafia Review;7.1;Good; If you only played the Xbox version of Mafia, you'd still get a sense of the game's ambitious nature, but you'd also miss out on the original PC version's outstandingly ...;
Tenchu: Return From Darkness Review;7.3;Good; If you've never played the PS2 version and have a hankering for some more ninja action, Tenchu: Return From Darkness will do you right.;
Unreal Tournament 2004 Review;9.4;Superb; No other multiplayer-focused action game has this much to offer.;
MVP Baseball 2004 Review;9;Superb; The core fundamentals are spot-on, the variety of options and control choices is spectacular, and the presentation totally draws you into the experience.;
Worms 3D Review;7.5;Good; Worms 3D is a pretty good strategy game, but taking the game into full 3D seems to have actually detracted from some of the depth found in the 2D games.;
Colin McRae Rally 04 Review;8.8;Great; Don't let the budget price tag fool you. Colin McRae Rally 04 is every bit as good as its most recent predecessor, and in many ways, it's quite a bit ...;
Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3: Athena Sword Review;7.8;Good; The expansion to last year's excellent shooter differs very little from its predecessor, in terms of plot, and heaps on more of the same tense tactical combat.;
MVP Baseball 2004 Review;9;Superb; The core fundamentals are spot-on, the variety of options and control choices is spectacular, and the presentation totally draws you into the experience.;
Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes Review;8.2;Great; As long as you're not expecting any huge additions to the Metal Gear milieu, The Twin Snakes serves as a great revival of a true classic.;
Corvette Review;4;Poor; When you get right down to it, Corvette is a difficult title to recommend to even the most devout Corvette enthusiast.;
Firefighter F.D. 18 Review;7.1;Good; Fighting fires instead of more typical corporeal opponents is certainly a refreshing change, but the gameplay can't make entirely good on Firefighter's unique concept.;
Worms 3D Review;7.5;Good; Worms 3D is a pretty good strategy game, but taking the game into full 3D seems to have actually detracted from some of the depth found in the 2D games.;
The Suffering Review;7.6;Good; The Suffering might be a little too straightforward in spots, but it does make for a solid action game.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
The Suffering Review;7.6;Good; The Suffering might be a little too straightforward in spots, but it does make for a solid action game.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
FireStarter Review;6.2;Fair; FireStarter is a decent shooter, but it lacks the imagination and polish that separate competent games from the ones you just can't put down.;
Carve Review;6.6;Fair; It focuses on simply providing a decent--if unspectacular--watercraft racing experience that can be played via Xbox Live and purchased at a budget price.;
Ozzy & Drix Review;3.5;Bad; Ozzy & Drix has nice 3D visuals, but the game comes up short in every other aspect.;
Dead Man's Hand Review;6;Fair; As an entry in one of the most competitive and most popular genres of gaming, Dead Man's Hand does not truly succeed on any level, despite a few nice touches.;
MTX Mototrax Review;7.2;Good; Mototrax is a solid entry into the world of motocross, but there are other games on the market that do it better.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Pitfall: The Lost Expedition Review;7.1;Good; Pitfall: The Lost Expedition is a decent side-scrolling action game that should appeal to younger players as well as longtime fans of the franchise.;
Phantasy Star Online Episode III: C.A.R.D. Revolution Review;7.2;Good; Though players who have already cut their teeth on other collectible card games will likely get the most out of the game, there's a chance that fans of turn-based strategy ...;
Yu-Gi-Oh! World Championship Tournament 2004 Review;6.1;Fair; Yu-Gi-Oh! World Championship Tournament 2004, is pure, uncompromised card battling, and it's probably one of the best Yu-Gi-Oh! games to come out on any platform.;
Steel Battalion: Line of Contact Review;7.3;Good; If you've already made the investment in the original game and its controller, then you might as well get some more use out of it by picking up the online ...;
MTX Mototrax Review;7.2;Good; Mototrax is a solid entry into the world of motocross, but there are other games on the market that do it better.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Mega Man Battle Chip Challenge Review;8.2;Great; Mega Man Battle Chip Challenge won't disappoint Mega Man fans with its engaging quest and fun combat;
Romance of the Three Kingdoms IX Review;7.3;Good; Romance IX is more of what you already love--that is, assuming you loved it to begin with.;
SpellForce: The Order of Dawn Review;7.9;Good; SpellForce's unique combination of role-playing and strategy elements makes it worth a look for fans of either kind of game.;
Monster Garage Review;3.3;Bad; The lack of any strategy to the gameplay, a generally poor design, and an endless number of stability problems turn Monster Garage into a real monster, all right.;
MX Unleashed Review;7.9;Good; MX Unleashed adds even more to the mix while keeping all of the stuff that made the previous games cool.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
LifeLine Review;6.5;Fair; LifeLine represents an ambitious undertaking, but the experience is undermined by unreliable technology and some poor game design.;
MX Unleashed Review;7.9;Good; MX Unleashed adds even more to the mix while keeping all of the stuff that made the previous games cool.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Drakengard Review;7;Good; The core action that dominates the gameplay is highly repetitive and not particularly interesting, but Drakengard is still worth a look from those intrigued by the game's strange theme.;
Championship Manager: Season 03/04 Review;8.6;Great; Who would have thought that one of the best games you could be playing on the PC was a text-based soccer management simulation?;
Cabela's Dangerous Hunts Review;6.8;Fair; Whether you find Cabela's Dangerous Hunts intense or terribly tedious will probably depend on your hunting knowledge and patience.;
Ninja Gaiden Review;9.4;Superb; This is one of the best, most challenging action adventure games ever made.;
World Soccer Winning Eleven 7 Review;9.1;Superb; While the majority of improvements made to this year's game might seem insignificant, they add up to a soccer experience that really is in a league of its own.;
Two Thrones Review;5.4;Mediocre; The limited scope, clunky build interface, and lackluster artificial intelligence mean this isn't a game for veteran strategy gamers looking for a challenge.;
SimCity 2000 Review;4.9;Poor; The screen size and button layout of the GBA prove to be limitations that this otherwise respectable port of SimCity 2000 cannot overcome.;
Total Pro Basketball Review;7.5;Good; Total Pro Basketball boasts a solid interface and a wide breadth of duties to keep general managers busy from opening tip-off to summertime free agency.;
Pitfall: The Lost Expedition Review;7.1;Good; If you're on the lookout for a solid platformer for a weekend rental, then Pitfall: The Lost Expedition is right up your alley.;
Pitfall: The Lost Expedition Review;7.1;Good; If you're on the lookout for a solid platformer for a weekend rental, then Pitfall: The Lost Expedition is right up your alley.;
Coliseum Review;3.8;Bad; Coliseum is surprisingly dull and sloppy, and it's lacking in both personality and depth.;
WWI: The Great War Review;4.8;Poor; Sadly, like the war it's based on, WWI: The Great War is an exercise in madness, frustration, helplessness, and human folly.;
Pitfall: The Lost Expedition Review;7.3;Good; If you're on the lookout for a solid platformer for a weekend rental, then Pitfall: The Lost Expedition is right up your alley.;
Riot Police Review;5.5;Mediocre; Control problems, micromanagement, and other flaws often make Riot Police a lot less fun than it could have been.;
Universal Combat Review;5.9;Mediocre; This wildly ambitious simulation is torpedoed by an almost incomprehensible interface, the absence of a tutorial, numerous bugs, and many fit and finish issues, including dated production values.;
Lupin the Third: Treasure Of The Sorceror King Review;6;Fair; Like many games based on popular licenses, Lupin the Third simply doesn't hold up when you break down its abilities as an actual game.;
FBI Hostage Rescue Review;1.9;Abysmal; FBI Hostage Rescue feels like a really bad amateur mod that was released before it was finished.;
Rise to Honor Review;6.6;Fair; Rise to Honor may have the flashy action and storytelling that you'd expect from a martial arts flick, but unfortunately, the gameplay doesn't hold up its end of the bargain.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
James Bond 007: Everything or Nothing Review;8.8;Great; Everything or Nothing is a really great game--perhaps the best James Bond game ever made.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Unreal II: The Awakening Review;6.1;Fair; Xbox owners will be underwhelmed by this version of Unreal II because it plays and feels like a watered-down port.;
Apache Longbow Assault Review;7.3;Good; Apache Longbow Assault is a game that doesn't do too much, but what it does, it does well.;
Alien Blast: The Encounter Review;3.3;Bad; Across every category, Alien Blast defines itself as the very epitome of boredom.;
Wars and Warriors: Joan of Arc Review;6.2;Fair; Designer Trevor Chan's first foray into action games yields mixed results, because this third-person hack-and-slash suffers from some rookie mistakes.;
James Bond 007: Everything or Nothing Review;8.8;Great; Everything or Nothing is a really great game--perhaps the best James Bond game ever made.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Total Pro Football Review;8.3;Great; Colorful graphics, an interface that practically takes you by the hand, and loads of added details and options make Total Pro Football the best inaugural football sim in years.;
James Bond 007: Everything or Nothing Review;8.8;Great; Everything or Nothing is a really great game--perhaps the best James Bond game ever made.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Ford Racing 2 Review;5.5;Mediocre; Empire's latest racer unfortunately does not offer enough excitement for the arcade crowd or nearly enough complexity for simulation hounds.;
Wrath Unleashed Review;7.3;Good; Wrath Unleashed should provide an entertaining experience and pretty good replay value for those who enjoy equal parts methodical strategy and button-mashing mayhem.;
Wrath Unleashed Review;7.3;Good; Wrath Unleashed should provide an entertaining experience and pretty good replay value for those who enjoy equal parts methodical strategy and button-mashing mayhem.;
Champions of Norrath Review;8.5;Great; The core components that make up the game all come together to create an experience that is, across the board, better than the original Dark Alliance and better than any ...;
Nightshade Review;7.9;Good; Those who like their games nice and easy shouldn't bother with Nightshade, while the rest of us can heartily appreciate it for its monumental challenge and tight, responsive controls.;
AirForce Delta Strike Review;6.5;Fair; The AirForce Delta series has always been of middling quality, and Strike does little to buck that trend.;
Silent Scope Complete Review;5.4;Mediocre; The versions of the Silent Scope games included in this package are all faithful enough to the originals, but the problem is that even with all four games included in ...;
Intellivision Lives! Review;6.8;Fair; Silly music and controller headaches aside, Intellivision Lives! does a fine job of compiling a huge number of games into one package and presents them in an easy-to-pick-up manner.;Video Producer/Shooter/Editor. Mass Consumer of Television &amp
FIFA Soccer 2004 Review;6.7;Fair; Though the game is far from perfect in most every regard, FIFA Soccer 2004 is easily the most accomplished traditional sports title for the N-Gage up to now.;
Vietcong: Fist Alpha Review;7.4;Good; Fist Alpha offers more of the intense and suspenseful single-player and multiplayer action that made Vietcong the respectable game that it is.;
Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles Review;8;Great; If you have two, or better yet three, friends with the requisite hardware and the interest and will to learn how the game works, then you're definitely going to enjoy ...;
Metroid: Zero Mission Review;8.5;Great; The entire presentation and the gameplay itself are totally first-rate in Metroid: Zero Mission. You'll just wish that there were more meat to the game.;
World Championship Pool 2004 Review;7.2;Good; If you're a pool enthusiast with an Xbox, you shouldn't hesitate to give World Championship Pool 2004 a look.;
Vegas Tycoon Review;7.5;Good; Vegas Tycoon has a lot of good things going for it, though it doesn't quite hit the million-dollar jackpot.;
Jack the Ripper Review;5.2;Mediocre; Jack the Ripper turns the usual gaming trend on its head: The developers spent a lot of time creating an engaging story but hardly put any gameplay into the game.;
Arc the Lad Collection Review;7.5;Good; The Arc the Lad Collection is ultimately an interesting, varied, and rewarding experience that has a tendency to sometimes get bogged down.;
Front Office Football 2004 Review;7.8;Good; Online league play and smart little tweaks make this the best game in the history of the Front Office Football series.;
Robin Hood: Defender of the Crown Review;6;Fair; Diehard fans of the original might enjoy Robin Hood: Defender of the Crown, but if you don't have any such emotional attachment, there are better alternatives.;
Sega GT Online Review;6.1;Fair; Regrettably, Sega GT Online's Xbox Live compatibility is far more problematic than its offline play.;
R-Type Final Review;8.1;Great; If R-Type must end, at least it's going out on a high note--rest assured that Final lives up to the classic R-Type name in every way.;
Mafia Review;7;Good; Because the PS2 version of Mafia compromises the PC version's graphical presentation and also introduces more interruptions into the gameplay, it comes off like a mere shadow of the original.;
Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance Review;8;Great; If you're looking for a hack-and-slash game on the go, this is the one to get.;
AMF Bowling 2004 Review;5.2;Mediocre; AMF Bowling 2004's clunky interface, general lack of gameplay variety, and stripped-down presentation leave it dull, confusing, and generally not much fun to play.;
Fast Lanes Bowling Review;5.2;Mediocre; Fast Lanes Bowling lacks substance and ultimately won't please bowling fans, be they hardcore or casual.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Auto Modellista Review;6.8;Fair; Auto Modellista has a fantastic look, but its gameplay unsuccessfully tries to straddle the line between simulation-style tuning options and arcade-style handling and collision physics.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Squad Assault: West Front Review;7.4;Good; It's an engaging and realistic tactical wargame that's hampered by lackluster graphics and a strong sense of dÌ©jÌÊ vu.;
Combat Mission: Afrika Korps Review;8.4;Great; Afrika Korps is the third installment of the acclaimed Combat Mission series, and like its predecessors, it represents the absolute state-of-the-art in tactical wargames.;
Pax Romana Review;4.9;Poor; There's little reward for all the indirect management you have to deal with, and the terrible interface sabotages the whole affair.;
IHRA Drag Racing 2 Review;5.4;Mediocre; While IHRA Drag Racing 2 does a great job of representing the sport of drag racing, it doesn't necessarily make for the greatest game.;
Star Trek: Shattered Universe Review;4.4;Poor; Perhaps if it existed in an alternate universe, Star Trek: Shattered Universe might be a game worth playing. Unfortunately, this is not the case.;
Sonic Heroes Review;6.2;Fair; Sonic Team almost seems to be daring you to try to have fun with the PlayStation 2 version by making it significantly uglier, slower, and generally just rougher around the ...;
Delta Force - Black Hawk Down: Team Sabre Review;7.1;Good; It may not be realistic, but Team Sabre is packed with explosions, wild gunfights, and quite a bit of fun--though it's also extremely frustrating at times.;
Need for Speed Underground Review;7.7;Good; Blocky graphics aside, Need for Speed Underground is a fun game that lets you design your own car and then lets you race it against opponents out on the mean ...;
Star Trek: Shattered Universe Review;4.4;Poor; Perhaps if it existed in an alternate universe, Star Trek: Shattered Universe might be a game worth playing. Unfortunately, this is not the case.;
Mobile Suit Gundam: Encounters in Space Review;7;Good; There are certainly better ways to get a fix for your giant robot jones, but Encounters in Space still stands as one of the more accessible Gundam games to be ...;
Inside the Park Baseball Review;7;Good; The appeal of portraying a rookie with big-league dreams and the solid stat-generation of the OOTP engine make Inside the Park Baseball captivating for a few virtual seasons.;
Corvette Review;4.3;Poor; When you get right down to it, Corvette is a difficult title to recommend to even the most devout Corvette enthusiasts.;
Medabots Infinity Review;5.4;Mediocre; Those who aren't already fans of this series should look elsewhere, and Medabots fans searching for a fix are far better off watching the cartoon instead.;
Conflict: Desert Storm II - Back to Baghdad Review;6.7;Fair; Conflict: Desert Storm II isn't without problems, but it's decidedly improved over the original game.;
Sonic Heroes Review;7;Good; Sonic Heroes is truer to its 2D roots than any other 3D Sonic game before it.;
Silent Storm Review;8.2;Great; Silent Storm is so over-the-top that the rough edges seem acceptable in the context of everything else, and overall, surely this is a game whose strengths outweigh its weaknesses.;
Dominions II: The Ascension Wars Review;6.2;Fair; Dominions II is a game that's brimming with ideas of what a fantasy strategy genre game should be. Unfortunately, it's also saddled with tons of micromanagement issues and a cumbersome ...;
Postal 2: Share the Pain Review;6.2;Fair; It may seem strange to put it this way, but Postal 2: Share the Pain is the game that Postal 2 probably should have been in the first place.;
Ford Racing 2 Review;6.8;Fair; Ford Racing 2 presents itself as a pretty exhilarating game, whether you're behind the wheel of a 1949 coupe or a GT40 concept car.;
NCAA Football Review;8;Great; NCAA Football's gameplay is a step beyond the competition.;
Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II Review;8;Great; Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II will surely satisfy players looking for a well-crafted, accessible action RPG experience.;
Midway Arcade Treasures Review;6.5;Fair; Some of the games featured just don't play the way they should, marring an otherwise stellar compilation.;Video Producer/Shooter/Editor. Mass Consumer of Television &amp
Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II Review;8;Great; Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II will surely satisfy players looking for a well-crafted, accessible action RPG experience.;
Blade and Sword Review;6.3;Fair; Blade and Sword's strengths do not outweigh its shortcomings, which is unfortunate because there are some nice gameplay elements to be found here.;
Unreal II: The Awakening Special Edition Review;7.9;Good; The new XMP mode isn't all that original, but it offers a solid multiplayer gameplay experience.;
Maximo vs. Army of Zin Review;8.4;Great; It's not for the faint of heart, but if you're looking for complex and rewarding action-platforming, Maximo vs. Army of Zin really satisfies.;
Super Trucks Racing Review;7.1;Good; Super Trucks Racing can be recommended simply for the fact that it emulates its chosen sport surprisingly well and does so at a meager price.;
Goblin Commander: Unleash the Horde Review;6.7;Fair; Console owners starved for a real-time strategy game should find Goblin Commander to be a worthwhile experience.;
King of Fighters EX2: Howling Blood Review;8.5;Great; King of Fighters EX2 sets a new standard for one-on-one fighting games on the GBA.;
Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing Review;1;Abysmal; Just how bad is Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing? It's as bad as your mind will allow you to comprehend.;
NFL Street Review;7.9;Good; If you've been eagerly waiting for some fast paced, hard-hitting football, NFL Street delivers what you're looking for.;
Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel Review;7.3;Good; It's basically a simple, mildly entertaining, and somewhat uneven quasi-futuristic dungeon crawl for one or two players.;
Chaos Legion Review;4.5;Poor; Chaos Legion is still a repetitive and bland hack-and-slash game on the PC, just as it was on the PlayStation 2.;
XGRA: Extreme-G Racing Association Review;7.2;Good; It's bigger and more ambitious than any of its predecessors, but XGRA is hindered by a few unfortunate technical and design issues.;
Yu-Gi-Oh: The Falsebound Kingdom Review;3.1;Bad; The game is both needlessly arcane and one-dimensional, which is a bit of a feat in and of itself.;
Sonic Battle Review;7.7;Good; The multiplayer battle mode is a real riot, and the fast-paced design makes up for most of Sonic Battle's shortcomings.;
Delta Ops: Army Special Forces Review;2.1;Terrible; Delta Ops: Army Special Forces is an awful game that isn't worth your time or money, and that simply shouldn't exist.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
NFL Blitz Pro Review;6.5;Fair; NFL Blitz Pro has good qualities, but ultimately, it tries much too hard to be something it isn't.;
Airport Tycoon 3 Review;5;Mediocre; It's unfortunate that the execution in the game is so disappointing in virtually every respect.;
.hack Part 4: Quarantine Review;6.1;Fair; Quarantine does wrap up the storyline, but those who couldn't bring themselves to stick with the .hack series really won't be missing out on much.;
BlowOut Review;5;Mediocre; Unless you've already played every other game available in this genre, look elsewhere for your gratuitous action needs, as BlowOut doesn't deliver.;
NFL Street Review;7.8;Good; If you've been eagerly waiting for some fast-paced, hard-hitting football, NFL Street delivers what you're looking for.;
Shadowbane: The Rise of Chaos Review;4.7;Poor; For Shadowbane's population of player-versus-player aficionados, the expansion doesn't seem to do much, nor does it do enough to compel new players to get into the game.;
Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel Review;7.3;Good; It's basically a simple, mildly entertaining, and somewhat uneven quasi-futuristic dungeon crawl for one or two players.;
Ultimate Demolition Derby Review;2;Terrible; Ultimate Demolition Derby sucks all the fun out of its subject matter and replaces it with half-baked driving physics, an ugly graphics engine, and a host of other problems.;
NFL Street Review;7.8;Good; If you've been eagerly waiting for some fast-paced, hard-hitting football, NFL Street delivers what you're looking for.;
Ring II: Twilight of Gods Review;2.5;Terrible; The utterly atrocious, incomprehensible Ring II is an insult to both gaming and a great composer.;
MotoGP Review;2.7;Terrible; The game has the riders, motorcycles, and tracks that make the MotoGP racing circuit what it is, but it fails to portray the actual thrill of racing at speeds in ...;Video Producer/Shooter/Editor. Mass Consumer of Television &amp
MLB Slam! Review;1.7;Abysmal; MLB Slam! is the first baseball game for the N-Gage, and, to be blunt, it's horrible.;Video Producer/Shooter/Editor. Mass Consumer of Television &amp
Red Faction Review;3.4;Bad; Featuring clunky controls, choppy animation, and a subpar frame rate, this reworking of a great game isn't one that you'd want to have with you on a desert island.;Video Producer/Shooter/Editor. Mass Consumer of Television &amp
Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas Review;5.7;Mediocre; Though the game features some competent gameplay mechanics and attractive graphics, the extremely short campaign mimics the film's brief theatrical run a little too well.;
Sonic Heroes Review;7.5;Good; Sonic Heroes is truer to its 2D roots than any other 3D Sonic game before it.;
Conflict: Desert Storm II - Back to Baghdad Review;6.3;Fair; If you're really into squad-based military action games, Desert Storm II might be worth a look, despite the unfortunate absence of any multiplayer features.;
Elf Bowling Review;7.2;Good; The first twenty minutes playing EB is a blast, but the fun trails off rapidly from there.;
Lemonade Tycoon Review;8.2;Great; This sim is deep and complex, with hours of gameplay for the dedicated sidewalk lemonade hustler.;
Journey to the Center of the Earth Review;6.1;Fair; Journey to the Center of the Earth is marred by bugs, design problems, low production values, and general sloppiness that usually overshadow its genuine charms.;
Atari: 80 Classic Games in One Review;6.6;Fair; This compilation has an incredible number of games for a budget price, but the translations of some of the better games unfortunately have some quirks.;Video Producer/Shooter/Editor. Mass Consumer of Television &amp
Horizons: Empire of Istaria Review;6.7;Fair; Unfortunately, Horizons offers little that hasn't already been done--and done better--by many other online role-playing games already on the market.;
Family Feud Review;7;Good; The latency issues aren't enough to keep Family Feud from being enjoyable as a mobile multiplayer game.;
Metalion Review;8.5;Great; If Space Harrier was fun back in the day, Metalion is even better on a cell.;
Sega Super Monkey Ball Review;9;Superb; Monkey Ball's bizarrely compelling gameplay and jocular premise make for a winning combination.;
Centipede Review;6.2;Fair; The slowdown isn't enough to submarine the fun in this title.;
Fox Sports Track and Field '04 Review;6.2;Fair; Fox Sports Track & Field '04 is a fun game overall, it's just not a particularly ambitious one.;
Qix Review;7.1;Good; Taito has done a good job of keeping the original feel of the game, but don't expect Tetris longevity.;
Tomb Raider: The Osiris Codex Review;8.4;Great; Believe it or not, it's more fun to play than the overblown console version.;
Fox Sports Football 04 Review;7;Good; Fox Sports Football '04 focuses on the thinking aspects of gridiron management while adding some interesting twists to the user interface.;
Puyo Puyo Review;7.9;Good; Puyo Puyo it is one of the most blissful puzzle experiences ever created, but it is slightly disappointing that we now must play the game in silence.;
School of Rock Audition Review;4.6;Poor; School of Rock: Audition isn't much good for anything besides whiling away detention.;
Pirates of the Caribbean Review;8.6;Great; It'll take more than a few control problems to keep Jack Sparrow down. Pirates of the Caribbean will suck you in with its cool storyline, and its RPG-esque stat building ...;
Ancient Empires Review;8.7;Great; Ancient Empires is a risky title, but in the end it comes off as a success.;
Pitfall: The Lost Expedition Review;8.2;Great;" The Lost Expedition is just hard enough to motivate you to bring your platforming ""A"" game, and it's generally a great title.";
Yao Ming Basketball '04 Review;4.4;Poor; Unless simply having Yao on your phone is enough to satisfy you, avoid this game.;
Dragon Fire 2 Review;9.1;Superb; Dragon Fire 2 is a cut above every other mobile shooter. It's polished enough to feel like an entirely novel experience;
Townsmen Review;7.8;Good; Townsmen is highly recommended to anyone who likes in-depth strategy games and doesn't mind floundering for a while due to its virtually impenetrable control scheme.;
Spider-Man Review;5.5;Mediocre; This version of Spider-Man only barely manages to evoke the webslinger.;
Rubik's Mobile Pipelines Review;8.3;Great; Download Rubik's Mobile Pipelines if you have any interest in puzzle games whatsoever.;
Super Putt Classic Review;7.5;Good; Annoyances like rather tardy course loading times and a less-than-rapid panning feature mean that SPC will be played at a very leisurely pace.;
Call of Duty Review;8;Great; While far from perfect, Call of Duty is exactly what real-time strategy lovers want in a mobile game.;
Wizard Pinball Review;7.1;Good; There's no arcade experience purer than a good game of pinball, and WP delivers.;
Bejeweled Multiplayer Review;9.4;Superb; While Bejeweled Multiplayer's graphics are a little on the murky side, it hardly touches the game's overall virtuosity.;
Top Gun Air Combat Review;7;Good; Thanks to its challenging and exciting gameplay, Air Combat is still a very entertaining romp through the not-so-friendly skies.;
Charlie's Angels: Road Cyclone Review;7.9;Good; The innovative gameplay makes what could have been a forgettable branded movie tie-in into a fun game.;
Duke Nukem Mobile Review;8.7;Great; It isn't as involved as it could be, but it's still a blast to play and rates as a worthy member of the illustrious Nukem franchise.;
Lion King Review;3.6;Bad; Even given its target kiddie audience, The Lion King falls short.;
Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Review;9.1;Superb; Gameloft has packed the most important stuff into mobile Splinter Cell.;
Haunted Mansion: Fear of the Dark Review;4.9;Poor; All but the most naive gamers will recognize The Haunted Mansion for what it is--a cleverly repackaged shooter.;
Shark Hunt Review;7.6;Good; Though the difficulty level was lowered considerably in the new version, Shark Hunt remains enough of a challenge to keep you coming back for more.;
Dell Magazines Crossword Review;9.1;Superb; Network access to puzzles makes this whole crosswording-on-your-phone thing worthwhile.;
Paradrop Review;6.1;Fair; What could have been a really addictive game falls a little short.;
PlanetZero Review;7.2;Good; Planet Zero should make any old-school shooter fanatic happy for a while.;
Nightmare Creatures Review;8.5;Great; It's a fast-paced, occasionally chaotic game--just like a good action game should be.;
Fantasy Warrior Review;7;Good; Fantasy Warrior is not very original, but the gameplay is silky smooth.;
Kung Fu Multiplayer Fudomyo Review;4.1;Poor; Network frustrations, poor production values, and boring, turn-based gameplay make Fudomyo a prime example of the proverbial failed-hype machine.;
Brave Shot Review;8.2;Great; The tight quarters, monstrous bosses, and attractive graphics combine to push it to the upper echelon of the shooter heap.;
Rayman Bowling Review;7.6;Good; The sound is on the simple side, but the graphics are crisp and colorful. The real strength of this title lies in level design.;
Crash 'N' Burn Review;9;Superb; It's amazing that Macrospace was able to cram the dozens of racetracks and options onto the cell.;
Tecmo Bowl Review;7;Good; The solid gameplay remains and the replay value is almost as high as the original, so expect to be playing this one for a while.;
Stuntman Review;7.2;Good; Stuntman is one of the most ambitious mobile-phone games ever--it's probably too ambitious. The game levels are open-ended and very, very long.;
Playman Shoot & Splash Review;9.1;Superb; It's a good single-player game due to the competitive aspect of setting and breaking your own records. But the multiplayer mode is fantastic.;
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King Review;8.8;Great; This is one adventure all gaming fans should seek out.;
ChessEverywhere Review;8;Great; ChessEverywhere is an addictive play recommended for experts and novices alike.;

XIII Review;8.7;Great; Even though it barely resembles the console version, it's one of the best side-scrolling action games available for the cell.;
Crash Bandicoot Review;9;Superb; Though somewhat dated, it's certainly the best game available for ExEn and is a killer mobile title overall.;
Gothic Graveyard Review;5.6;Mediocre; Graveyard succeeds at bringing back memories of classic horror games. But as it turns out, those memories are better than this game.;
Tron 2.0: Light Cycles Review;6.9;Fair; As an extension of the movie franchise, it is decent. As a stand-alone experience, it is fairly mediocre.;
X-Men 2: Battle Review;7;Good; Easy on the eyes but hard on the hands, Battle has some great strengths and some crippling weaknesses.;
Skate & Slam Review;7.6;Good; Give Skate & Slam a chance, especially if you're burnt out on Tony Hawk. Its simple gameplay, clean controls, and arcade atmosphere make it a solid, fun title.;
Snood Review;8.1;Great; The gameplay provides a challenge for newcomers and experienced Snooders alike, as there is always more than one way to approach a puzzle.;
Dracula Review;7;Good; Despite its simplicity, Dracula is one of our favorite mobile platformers to date;
Pitfall! Review;7.1;Good; Less graphically rich than the original version of the game, the mobile version of Pitfall will still make you nostalgic for the good old days of 4-bit gaming.;
Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Raven Shield Review;8.2;Great; Raven Shield is a welcome addition to the slim stealth gaming category on wireless.;
Ki-Tai Fighting Review;8.1;Great; Ki-Tai has a wide range of fighting options, beautiful scenery, and challenging gameplay. It's an all-around great download.;

Tetris Review;8;Great; Colorful and entertaining, Tetris is a solid port;
Jamdat Bowling Review;7;Good; Despite its extreme simplicity, Jamdat Bowling is the type of game you'll play again and again.;
Tony Hawk's Underground Review;8.9;Great; With each new Tony Hawk title, this franchise is getting stronger. T.H.U.G. continues that very encouraging trend.;
3D Golf Review;7;Good; 3D Golf is addictive, and the only letdown is the lack computer opponent variety.;
The Fast and the Furious Review;5.5;Mediocre; The Fast and the Furious is a valiant attempt at an overhead racing title. Unfortunately, control issues keep the emergency brake on this one.;
The Joker's Wild Review;7.6;Good; The Joker's Wild is a great trivia game with enduring replay value.;
Finding Nemo Review;5.2;Mediocre; The challenge provided by Finding Nemo's poorly implemented control will not be enough to hold the attention of most gamers.;
Knuckle Up Review;7.4;Good; Knuckle Up packs a lot of classic flavor into its mobile punch. Its simplified, robust gameplay makes it a great game for the medium.;
Grammy Music Challenge Review;7.1;Good; It's best played with a group of friends that alternates listening intently with competitively screaming out the name of each song as it is identified.;
Congo Cube Review;7.1;Good; Congo Cube is a terrifically fun puzzler and a great concept.;
EverQuest: Hero's Call Review;8.9;Great; Hero's Call lacks the multiplayer experience of the PC version but not the depth. It will give mobile players a lot to be happy about.;
Highway Racer Review;7.7;Good; If racing games are your thing, then Highway Racer is definitely worth a try.;
Nightmare Review;8.1;Great; Despite its frustrating control, Nightmare delivers some quality action.;
Ministry of Sound Dance Nation Review;8.1;Great; All in all, Ministry of Sound has brought us a super-ultralight edition of Space Channel 5.;
Fox Sports Racing Review;8.2;Great; Challenging your racing mind as well as your reflexes, Sorrent's Fox Sports Racing is a superior driving simulation.;
Tetris Tournament for Prizes Review;6.9;Fair; If you are a complete maniac for Tetris, the competition will draw you back into the game. But other gamers might find the original version more enjoyable.;
Spy Hunter Review;8.8;Great; Spy Hunter falls short of perfection, but is one of the best games in recent memory and a blast to play alone or with friends.;
Felix Frenzy Review;3.1;Bad; Avoid this game unless you are both a masochist and an obsessive Felix the Cat aficionado.;
Precision Pinball Review;8.3;Great; Knockabout went out and built a really killer pinball game.;
Samurai Jack: Samurai Showdown Review;6.4;Fair; Samurai Jack: Samurai Showdown did provide an hour or so of mindless action, but with a little more attention this game could have been really killer.;

Gundam Space Assault Review;8.9;Great; It's tough, it's fast, and it's really fun.;
Yo Yo Fighter Review;7.5;Good; Yo-Yo Fighter looks really good, but unfortunately, it's terribly short.;
Balloon Headed Boy Review;8.3;Great; If you can get over the freak-out factor, you'll see that Balloon Headed Boy is a very enjoyable, high- quality platform game.;
Jamdat Bowling 2 Review;8.9;Great; Even though it's a clone of the original, Jamdat Bowling 2 adds a ton of interesting new features and is a very worthwhile download.;
Atomica Review;8.3;Great; Among the numerous bland puzzlers on the cell, Atomica stands out as a very fun and original title.;
BombLink Review;7.7;Good; Not merely a Tetris clone, BombLink succeeds in delivering an innovative action-puzzle experience.;
Ace Yeti Trapper Review;8.8;Great; It's a must-have addition to your game collection if you like maze-running games of any variety.;
MotoGP 2 Review;8.3;Great; Never before has the feeling of pure speed translated so well to mobile.;
AquaX Review;5.9;Mediocre; AquaX is a decent water-racing title with some interesting features to go along with its weaknesses.;
Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Review;9.2;Superb; While the fighting is fun, the game requires more brains than brawn.;
Bomberman Special Review;8.3;Great; It's tough not to love this game.;
Aliens: Unleashed Review;5;Mediocre; If you do happen to get addicted to the combat, there's plenty of it to be found.;
Charisma Lee Review;6.9;Fair; Although the ludicrous dialogue is reason enough to play this game, it's not just a novelty title.;
Ed Edd n Eddy: Giant Jawbreakers Review;7.5;Good; The premise itself is addictive, and Macrospace has added quite a few twists that make the game shine.;
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone Review;6.1;Fair; Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is an unremarkable game that diehard fans may enjoy, but it's one that casual gamers and Potter fans may want to think twice about ...;
Patrician III Review;7.2;Good; Patrician III isn't much of a sequel, but the core gameplay still makes for a deeply intricate and challenging business game.;
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone Review;6.1;Fair; Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is an unremarkable game that diehard fans may enjoy, but it's one that casual gamers and Potter fans may want to think twice about ...;
One Must Fall: Battlegrounds Review;7.1;Good; There certainly isn't anything else out there that's quite like it, so fans of other fighting games should give it a look.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
James Bond 007: Everything or Nothing Review;7.1;Good; Everything or Nothing is a brief yet satisfying action game that faithfully captures the look and feel of a typical James Bond movie.;
Dragon Island Review;6.1;Fair; Dragon Island is fairly challenging for a platformer, but part of the challenge lies in the wonky controls.;
X2: The Threat Review;7.4;Good; It starts very slowly and has a steep learning curve, but if you're patient enough to stick with it, you'll probably find that X2 is a diamond in the rough.;
Trainz Railroad Simulator 2004 Review;7.9;Good; Trainz 2004 could have used more polish and improvement in some areas, but overall it's a welcome addition to the growing Trainz franchise.;
Dark Age of Camelot: Trials of Atlantis Review;7;Good; Trials of Atlantis creates a diversion for experienced players who are growing weary of the current realm-versus-realm gameplay, but unfortunately, it doesn't offer anything compelling for new players.;
Western Outlaw: Wanted Dead or Alive Review;3;Bad; Western Outlaw's primitive production values, brain-dead AI, and shamefully brief campaign make it a game that everyone should definitely avoid.;
Multiplayer Scrabble Review;7.9;Good; If you like Scrabble, you'll enjoy challenging people all over the world to a game.;
You Don't Know Jack 6: The Lost Gold Review;7;Good; You may be disappointed at how it refuses to deviate from the series' formula, but as with the other games, you'll still probably get a kick out of the questions.;

Dragon Ball Z: Taiketsu Review;2.7;Terrible; Atari and Webfoot have combined to deliver a game that not even the series' hardcore fans can enjoy.;
Mission: Impossible: Operation Surma Review;5;Mediocre; Operation Surma doesn't look good, and the gameplay is often awkward and frustrating.;
RC Cars Review;6.3;Fair; For what it is, RC Cars isn't a bad game. However, the distinct lack of features, compared to Creat's previous RC racing title, is a pretty big disappointment.;
Curse: The Eye of Isis Review;6.8;Fair; Curse is without even the tiniest smidgen of originality, though it is a convincing memorial to a classic genre.;
Monster 4x4: Masters of Metal Review;5;Mediocre; While the GameCube isn't exactly long on off-road racing games, you can certainly find something better than Masters of Metal.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
EverQuest Online Adventures: Frontiers Review;6.8;Fair; Most of the new content in Frontiers is really only suited to the game's hardcore players.;
Monster 4x4: Masters of Metal Review;5;Mediocre; Monster 4x4 offers a decent amount of different tracks and courses, but nothing that you do on any of these courses is the least bit interesting.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Airborne Assault: Highway to the Reich Review;8.1;Great; Highway to the Reich is a rich, rewarding game and a great example of how the designers are using the PC to push wargaming into new and exciting directions.;
Harry Potter: Quidditch World Cup Review;4.6;Poor; Quidditch was never meant to be anything more than a simple, fictional sport, so it isn't deep enough to carry a stand-alone video game.;
Max Payne Review;7.1;Good; Unfortunately, this Max Payne serves better as an incredibly neat idea than as a full-fledged game.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon Review;5.3;Mediocre; The gameplay doesn't do anything a thousand other identical games haven't done before, and the frustratingly repetitive level and mission designs further solidify Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon as a mediocre ...;
Legacy of Kain: Defiance Review;6.9;Fair; Legacy of Kain: Defiance has an outstanding premise, but it's ultimately a disappointment.;
Star Chamber Review;8.8;Great; Star Chamber combines elegance, interesting gameplay choices, and the attraction of card-collecting in what has to be one of the very best pure game designs of the year.;
Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon Review;4.7;Poor; Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon retells the story of the film just fine, but it doesn't deliver much in the way of thrills.;
Group S Challenge Review;6.2;Fair; Group S Challenge is a decent but plain racing game that doesn't really excel in any one category.;
Resident Evil Code: Veronica X Review;6.9;Fair; It's still technically a solid game, but at this point it almost feels totally obsolete.;
Spyro: Attack of the Rhynocs Review;8;Great; Attack of the Rhynocs is larger and more pleasing to the senses than previous Spyro games on the GBA.;
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines Review;4.8;Poor; There are many other shooters available for the Game Boy Advance that are better and less thrown-together than Terminator 3, and as such, the game simply cannot be recommended.;
I-Ninja Review;7.5;Good; I-Ninja is a short but well-crafted third-person action game with a surprising variety of gameplay.;
Operation Armored Liberty Review;4.2;Poor; Most players will have their fill of Operation Armored Liberty in an hour or two.;
Mysterious Journey II: Chameleon Review;5.1;Mediocre; Mysterious Journey II is filled with lots of arbitrary, convoluted, brutally tough puzzles. In fact, you could say this is really a puzzle game masquerading as an adventure game.;
NCAA Football 2004 Review;5.5;Mediocre; Although NCAA 2004 contains plenty of modes, it is plagued by some aggravating gameplay problems, as well as a distinct lack of presentational polish.;
The Sims Bustin' Out Review;8.3;Great; The Sims Bustin' Out makes good, solid improvements over its predecessor and stands on its own as a great version of The Sims for consoles.;
Bionicle Review;4.7;Poor; All the wonder of the Bionicle universe has been bled dry by vapid design and an atrocious camera system.;
Activision Anthology Review;7.5;Good; While the comprehensiveness of this collection is its greatest selling point, there's an exceptional amount of replay value here as well.;

Pokemon Channel Review;5.4;Mediocre; If you ever thought it would be cool to hang out with Pikachu, think again.;
The Sims Bustin' Out Review;8.3;Great; The Sims Bustin' Out makes good, solid improvements over its predecessor and stands on its own as a great version of The Sims for consoles.;
Mucha Lucha! Mascaritas of the Lost Code Review;3.2;Bad; Mucha Lucha! Mascaritas of the Lost Code is a game so utterly devoid of challenge that actually calling it a game almost seems too generous.;
Culdcept Review;7.9;Good; The well-designed mechanics, combined with its sheer amount of content, make Culdcept easily recommendable to fans of strategy games and even to fans of role-playing games.;
Yu-Gi-Oh! Power of Chaos - Yugi the Destiny Review;4.9;Poor; Beyond dueling with the AI, there isn't anything else to Power of Chaos--no story mode, no multiplayer, nothing.;
Tokyo Xtreme Racer 3 Review;6.4;Fair; Even as a budget title, TXR3 doesn't stand up to the other games in the genre.;
The Sims Bustin' Out Review;8.3;Great; The Sims Bustin' Out makes good, solid improvements over its predecessor and stands on its own as a great version of The Sims for consoles.;
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Review;7.1;Good; The Sands of Time is a platformer with equal parts swashbuckling and puzzling that should keep fans of cerebral action games entertained throughout.;
Lock On: Modern Air Combat Review;7.6;Good; Lock On clearly has the potential to be an all-time classic sim, but there are some serious problems in the retail version.;
Dr. Seuss' The Cat in the Hat Review;3.8;Bad; The Cat in the Hat just does not work as a generic run-and-jump game.;

SSX 3 Review;8.1;Great; SSX 3 for the GBA is graphically impressive and does a nice job of duplicating many of the features found in the console versions.;
American Idol Review;5.1;Mediocre; If you want a good rhythm game, look elsewhere. And if you want American Idol, just go watch the show.;
Korea: Forgotten Conflict Review;6.7;Fair; It's an admirable effort to make a Commandos-style game about the Korean War, but Forgotten Conflict suffers from bugs, bad AI, and some frustrating gameplay.;
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Review;6.3;Fair; Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles doesn't wear its nostalgic aspects particularly well, and the remaining components simply don't make for a very entertaining experience.;
Fatal Frame Review;8.2;Great; Fatal Frame II: Crimson Butterfly may be light on challenge, but it's still rich in great, dark atmosphere.;

Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Review;7;Good; Splinter Cell for the N-Gage is ultimately a good effort at trying to capture the original game's suspenseful gameplay in a 2D side scroller.;

Gekido Advance: Kintaro's Revenge Review;6.9;Fair; In a lot of ways, Gekido Advance: Kintaro's Revenge feels less like a commercial product and more like a fan-made tribute to the genre of 2D beat-'em-ups.;
I-Ninja Review;7.5;Good; I-Ninja is a short but well-crafted third-person action game with a surprising variety of gameplay.;
The Sims Bustin' Out Review;8.1;Great; While Bustin' Out isn't the same game as The Sims, it certainly has enough variety to appeal to anyone who enjoys this sort of open-ended game.;
Mission: Impossible: Operation Surma Review;7.3;Good; Operation Surma takes no big chances with the stealth genre's rules, but it's a well-made and entertaining game all the same.;
Magic: The Gathering - Battlegrounds Review;6.9;Fair; Magic: The Gathering - Battlegrounds could have benefited from a better interface, but at its core, it's still a decent game.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.

Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Review;8.9;Great; It's fairly short, and it's missing the console versions' bonus features, but Prince of Persia is a truly excellent action adventure game for as long as it lasts.;
Rayman 3 Review;7.6;Good; Rayman 3 proves to be one of the N-Gage's best games so far, simply by virtue of the fact that it provides a fun experience without too many caveats.;
Wildlife Park Review;5.2;Mediocre; It may have lions and tigers and bears, but don't bother. Wildlife Park is a lackluster imitation in the already crowded theme park genre.;
Kya: Dark Lineage Review;8.2;Great; Kya is a top-notch production from top to bottom, and the experience of playing it is surely worth the time of any 3D action adventure fan.;

Gotcha Force Review;5;Mediocre; Gotcha Force crutches itself far too heavily on brainless, clunky, and spastic action that doesn't so much entertain as it bewilders.;
Silent Hill 3 Review;7.6;Good; Silent Hill 3 isn't so much about gameplay as it is about creating a disturbing look and feel and immersing you in it, which is something it does very well.;

Desert Thunder Review;5.2;Mediocre; If you're hell-bent on seeing a bunch of explosions, you'll find some things to like about Desert Thunder. If you're looking for anything more substantial, look elsewhere.;

Auto Modellista Review;6.2;Fair; Auto Modellista has a great look, but its gameplay unsuccessfully tries to straddle the line between simulation-style tuning options and arcade-style handling and collision physics.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Deus Ex: Invisible War Review;8;Great; Deus Ex: Invisible War can be highly rewarding, as long as you're willing to look past some problems along the way.;
I-Ninja Review;7.5;Good; I-Ninja is a short but well-crafted third-person action game with a surprising variety of gameplay.;
Whiplash Review;6.4;Fair; Humor is the only thing Whiplash seems to really nail, and chuckles alone aren't enough to carry an entire game.;

Deus Ex: Invisible War Review;8;Great; Deus Ex: Invisible War can be highly rewarding, as long as you're willing to look past some problems along the way.;
Beyond Good & Evil Review;8.3;Great; While the game feels pretty short, its interesting premise and impressive presentation pick up the slack and make Beyond Good & Evil a game well worth playing.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Drake of the 99 Dragons Review;1.6;Abysmal; To simply call Drake bad would be a major understatement.;

Warhammer 40000: Fire Warrior Review;5.7;Mediocre; Warhammer 40,000: Fire Warrior has exchanged all of the depth and dynamism of the Games Workshop franchise for a shooter-by-numbers approach.;
Whiplash Review;6.6;Fair; Humor is the only thing Whiplash seems to really nail, and chuckles alone aren't enough to carry an entire game.;
FIFA Soccer 2004 Review;7.8;Good; If you're a returning veteran, you may want to weigh the game's new perks against some of its downfalls before you set down your hard-earned cash.;

Port Royale Review;8.5;Great; Once you get past Port Royale's steep learning curve, you may find yourself enthralled by the game's promise of profiteering and pirating on the high seas.;

RTX Red Rock Review;4.9;Poor; RTX Red Rock is one of those games that has a promising concept, but just doesn't pan out.;
Hitman 2: Silent Assassin Review;8.4;Great; Hitman 2 is late to the party on the GameCube, but owners of Nintendo's system would be better off playing it late than never.;

V-Rally 3 Review;8.2;Great; With exciting action, a strong career mode, and attractive graphics, V-Rally 3 is an impressive rally racing game.;

X2: Wolverine's Revenge Review;5.8;Mediocre; It's certainly not the worst X-Men-licensed game, but Wolverine's Revenge is a game only the biggest fans of the comics could love.;

X2: Wolverine's Revenge Review;5.8;Mediocre; It's certainly not the worst X-Men-licensed game, but Wolverine's Revenge is a game only the biggest fans of the comics could love.;

Postal 2 Review;4.8;Poor; Postal 2 strings together a bunch of violent novelties without ever constructing a compelling game for them to support.;
Furious Karting Review;5.8;Mediocre; The fundamentals are relatively sound, but the overall lack of options, from the sparse selection of power-ups to the lean multiplayer component, greatly limit the game's appeal.;
Bandits: Phoenix Rising Review;7;Good; It's a straightforward car combat game that promises straightforward driving and shooting action and more or less fulfills that promise.;
CSI: Crime Scene Investigation Review;5.1;Mediocre; The developer clearly tried to make CSI accessible for a wide audience and in the process also removed all challenge from the game.;
Disney Sports Skateboarding Review;2.2;Terrible; Disney Sports Skateboarding serves no purpose in this world, save to exemplify and showcase everything that can feasibly go wrong with a skateboarding game.;
The Lost Vikings Review;7.1;Good; The Lost Vikings is a challenging game that takes a while to finish.;

Red Faction II Review;7.4;Good; Red Faction II can offer some good shooting action for fans of the genre.;

Gallop Racer 2003: A New Breed Review;5.4;Mediocre; Though Gallop Racer 2003 does make some halfhearted attempts to make simulated horse racing more appealing to a broader audience, it's just not enough.;
Casino Inc. Review;5.2;Mediocre; Casino Inc. ends up being a game that's more complicated, and less fun, than it probably should have been.;

Devastation Review;6.3;Fair; Devastation is an ambitious but seriously flawed shooter.;

Legends of Wrestling II Review;2.4;Terrible; Acclaim's wrestling game falls short in every respect.;
Dark Age of Camelot: Shrouded Isles Review;8.2;Great; Dark Age of Camelot is still one of the best online role-playing games on the market, and Shrouded Isles makes it bigger and better.;
NHL 2K3 Review;8.6;Great; Now that the series has moved on to all platforms, no one will have an excuse not to play what has become the best hockey game series on the market.;
Dungeons and Dragons Eye of the Beholder Review;5.1;Mediocre; The game has a decidedly dated and awkward feel to it, though GBA owners who are also D&D fans will find some redeeming qualities.;
NCAA College Basketball 2K3 Review;7.5;Good; NCAA College Basketball 2K3 is a solid game with plenty of modes to choose from, but it ultimately falls short of being an accurate simulation of college basketball.;
Street Fighter Alpha 3 Review;8.4;Great; It's not just one of the better fighting games from the last five years--it's also a terrific game to have on the go.;
Whiteout Review;4.3;Poor; Whiteout's technical and creative deficiencies keep it from being recommendable to anyone.;
Evolution Worlds Review;6.5;Fair; Evolution Worlds doesn't set its sights particularly high and as such is fine for what it is: a lighthearted, entry-level role-playing game best suited for younger players.;
V-Rally 3 Review;8.2;Great; With its incredible graphics, convincing handling, and satisfying challenge, V-Rally 3 for the Game Boy Advance is a very solid racing game.;
Street Hoops Review;4.2;Poor; Anyone looking for basketball, arcade-style or otherwise, would be better served by NBA Street, NBA 2K3, or just about any other GameCube basketball game.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Neocron Review;6.6;Fair; While the promise of political intrigue in a futuristic setting will draw you into the game, Neocron's inability to make a significant impact will push you away.;
Phantasy Star Collection Review;8.6;Great; The fact that you get three games of great length and quality on one cartridge makes Phantasy Star Collection well worth the price of admission.;Video Producer/Shooter/Editor. Mass Consumer of Television &amp
Worms Blast Review;7.6;Good; If you're a fan of puzzle games, you should definitely give this one a try.;
Anarchy Online: The Notum Wars Review;6.8;Fair; Anarchy Online's technical performance has improved since it was released a year ago, but Notum Wars may still prove intimidating for newcomers.;
NCAA College Basketball 2K3 Review;7.3;Good; NCAA College Basketball 2K3 is a solid game with plenty of modes to choose from, but it ultimately falls short of being an accurate simulation of college basketball.;
Gauntlet Dark Legacy Review;4.3;Poor; The absolute worst part is that the game doesn't have any multiplayer support.;
Darkened Skye Review;6.6;Fair; If sarcastic humor and some cringingly bad puns don't sound like your idea of good comedy, you should probably pass on Darkened Skye.;
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Review;7.3;Good; Offering a polished mix of strong graphics and solid gameplay, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a marked improvement over its predecessor.;
WWE Road to WrestleMania X8 Review;8.1;Great; If you like the WWE, you'll probably enjoy WWE Road to WrestleMania X8.;
Masters of the Universe - He-Man: Power of Grayskull Review;4.1;Poor; The game's collision programming is quite frustrating, so much so that many players may just up and quit after they experience any number of truly unfair situations.;
Street Legal Review;4.2;Poor; Street Legal is hard to recommend to any racing fans who aren't willing to wait on the next patch.;
Blood Omen 2 Review;7.1;Good; Blood Omen 2 does have its strong points, but, much like the original, its fiendish main character is the best thing about it.;
The Lord of the Rings The Two Towers Review;7.5;Good; It's surprisingly fun to roam throughout the lands of Middle-earth, slaying orcs and goblins, leveling up a character, and snagging all of the loot you can before the game ends.;
Haven: Call of the King Review;7.6;Good; While there's an excellent chance that fans of platformers will love Haven's diversity and challenge, some may find it a little too restless and overdone.;
Star Wars: The Clone Wars Review;7.3;Good; It's a good, solid Star Wars game that should appeal to anyone who'd care to relive Episode II's large-scale action scenes.;
Treasure Planet: Battle at Procyon Review;7;Good; Treasure Planet may not be the next Homeworld, but it's short and sweet--just not very deep.;
Godzilla: Domination! Review;7.2;Good; There are better traditional fighting games out there that will probably spend more time in your GBA than this one--but Godzilla, Mothra, and King Ghidorah aren't in those games.;
Egg Mania: Eggstreme Madness Review;6.4;Fair; Puzzle fans willing to look past its superficial shortcomings will find a fun, harmless diversion in Egg Mania.;
Minority Report: Everybody Runs Review;4.1;Poor; Minority Report's uneven presentation and its incongruence with the spirit of the movie make it just another bad licensed-property video game.;
Star Wars Bounty Hunter Review;6.5;Fair; Bounty Hunter has its good points, and the GameCube version is markedly better than the PlayStation 2 release.;
Minority Report: Everybody Runs Review;4.1;Poor; Minority Report's uneven presentation and its incongruence with the spirit of the movie make it just another bad licensed-property video game.;
Legends of Wrestling II Review;6.2;Fair; Legends of Wrestling II is difficult to recommend to all but the hard-core wrestling fan looking for a little nostalgia.;

Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land Review;7.9;Good; The graphics have been brought up to modern standards, and the gameplay and level designs are intact with minor alterations, the majority of which are positive.;
Cossacks: Back to War Review;6.6;Fair; Back to War is difficult to recommend to anyone who isn't a die-hard fan of the Cossacks series.;
James Bond 007: NightFire Review;6;Fair; The PC version of NightFire makes an excellent case for leaving James Bond on console systems.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Rally Fusion Review;6.9;Fair; It's one of the few rally games not to focus on the World Rally Championship, and its inclusion of nearly a dozen driving modes is certainly admirable.;
Star Wars: The New Droid Army Review;5.2;Mediocre; When you're playing an action game, the last thing you want to do is to stand around regaining stamina while there are still aliens left to fight.;
Legends of Wrestling II Review;6;Fair; With much better alternatives available on the PS2, Legends of Wrestling II can't be recommended to anyone but the hard-core wrestling fan looking for a little nostalgia.;
Legends of Wrestling II Review;6;Fair; Legends of Wrestling II is difficult to recommend to all but the hard-core wrestling fan looking for a little nostalgia.;

Rocky Review;5.5;Mediocre; Unfortunately, Rocky is completely spoiled by a few major problems.;
The Revenge of Shinobi Review;4.3;Poor; You walk from left to right, you slash at cookie-cutter enemies, and you keep doing that until you're finished.;
Hegemonia: Legions of Iron Review;7.9;Good; Hegemonia's solid, innovative gameplay and technically impressive graphics may seem very appealing to space strategy fans, but it's too bad that the game isn't more accessible and more polished.;
Rally Fusion Review;6.9;Fair; It's one of the few rally games not to focus on the World Rally Championship, and its inclusion of nearly a dozen driving modes is certainly admirable.;
NCAA College Basketball 2K3 Review;7.5;Good; NCAA College Basketball 2K3 is a solid basketball game with plenty of modes to choose from, but it ultimately falls short of being an accurate simulation of college basketball.;
Justice League: Injustice for All Review;5;Mediocre; Justice League: Injustice for All has nothing to differentiate it from the scores of other action adventure games on store shelves.;
NASCAR: Dirt to Daytona Review;8.1;Great; Dirt to Daytona is a sound NASCAR simulation with one of the most robust career modes of any driving game to date.;
Asheron's Call 2: Fallen Kings Review;8.3;Great; Asheron's Call 2 is a highly streamlined, highly accessible online RPG. Yet the world of Dereth seems bare for a number of reasons.;

Robotech: The Macross Saga Review;6.5;Fair; The Macross Saga would be forgettable if not for its strong license.;

Silent Hill 2 Review;6.2;Fair; The problem with Silent Hill 2 is that it's all atmosphere and no real scares.;
Total Immersion Racing Review;7.7;Good; The game has a variety of gorgeous real-life cars, race-long bumper-to-bumper action, and emotionally charged AI drivers--too many positive attributes to be ignored.;
Tomb Raider: The Prophecy Review;8.3;Great; Tomb Raider: The Prophecy delivers the full Tomb Raider experience with no compromises.;
Dragon's Lair 3D: Return to the Lair Review;5.1;Mediocre; Players old enough to remember the original Dragon's Lair fondly would be better off checking out the DVD version of the original Dragon's Lair.;
Ninja Assault Review;5.6;Mediocre; Its graphics are lacking, the level of challenge isn't up to snuff, and the whole experience is over way too quickly.;
NBA Live 2003 Review;8.7;Great; There aren't too many other basketball games on the PC to choose from, but any fan of the sport should give NBA Live 2003 a try.;
Star Wars Bounty Hunter Review;5.4;Mediocre; Serious Star Wars aficionados should enjoy the game's story, but they'll be forced to slog through a lot of tedious action to see how it pans out.;
Die Hard: Vendetta Review;4.8;Poor; Considering how crowded the first-person shooter market has gotten lately, there really shouldn't be much room in your collection for Die Hard: Vendetta.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
BMX XXX Review;5.4;Mediocre; Aside from making the 'groundbreaking' move of featuring a lot of cursing and strippers, BMX XXX doesn't do anything particularly well.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Defender Review;4.9;Poor; The ability to play the original, unmodified Defender is the real joy of this cartridge.;
Mystic Heroes Review;7.3;Good; If you liked the pacing and mechanics of Gauntlet or the old Final Fight style of side-scrolling beat-'em-ups, then Mystic Heroes is a great expansion and is an improvement on ...;
Dragon's Lair 3D: Return to the Lair Review;5.3;Mediocre; Dragon's Lair 3D simply isn't a very good game on its own merits.;
James Bond 007: NightFire Review;7.9;Good; While NightFire is hurt by its relatively short length, the game's single-player mode is well constructed, and its multiplayer mode is good too.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.

Hearts of Iron Review;7;Good; The path to victory in Hearts of Iron can be rewarding, but it can be pretty bumpy too.;

Marvel vs. Capcom 2 Review;7;Good; Marvel vs. Capcom 2 takes the series' long-running brand of fighting insanity a step or two further, making for Capcom's flashiest 2D fighter to date.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
James Bond 007: NightFire Review;7.9;Good; While NightFire is hurt by its relatively short length, the game's single-player mode is well constructed, and its multiplayer mode is good too.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
The Simpsons Skateboarding Review;3.9;Bad; Only the most casual of gamers or the most hard-core of The Simpsons fans will be able to enjoy The Simpsons Skateboarding.;
World War II: Panzer Claws Review;6.9;Fair; Panzer Claws is a decent game, but if you're looking for another Earth 2150, or even an Earth 1942, you won't find it here.;
Superman: The Man of Steel Review;6.4;Fair; The repetitive mission structure will more than likely deter all but the Superman faithful.;
Doom II Review;8.1;Great; There are a handful of other first-person shooters on the Game Boy Advance, and a few of them are certainly more complete when it comes to overall design, but none ...;
Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Review;8.4;Great; Ghost Recon makes excellent use of the Xbox Live service, giving it replay value well beyond that of its PC counterpart.;
Revolution Review;2.7;Terrible; Revolution is clearly an experiment in fun gone monstrously wrong.;
Michael Schumacher Racing World Kart 2002 Review;5.6;Mediocre; It's ultimately too simplistic, too short, and far too prone to bumper-car madness and pinball-like ricochets.;
Game & Watch Gallery 4 Review;7;Good; The games are certainly strong enough to stand on their gameplay alone.;
Dr. Muto Review;6.5;Fair; With so many other great platforming games available for the PlayStation 2, Dr. Muto is incredibly difficult to recommend as anything but a rental.;
Dr. Muto Review;6.5;Fair; Dr. Muto is worth a rental for those eager for some kind of platforming on the Xbox, but everyone else should steer clear.;
Dr. Muto Review;6.5;Fair; The ability to transform into different creatures and the fact that they play so differently from each other is Dr. Muto's best trait, but it's one that's overshadowed by other ...;
Rygar: The Legendary Adventure Review;7.3;Good; Rygar is still a fun game with beautiful visuals and an excellent soundtrack, and fans of the genre should take the time to experience it.;
Steel Battalion Review;7.3;Good; With a $200 price tag and an occasionally punishing approach, Steel Battalion was clearly designed to scare off all but the most hard-core game players.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Battle Realms: Winter of the Wolf Review;7.3;Good; Fans of real-time strategy gaming who might have missed Battle Realms amid last year's busy holiday season may still do well to give the game a look at this time.;
Shox Review;7.9;Good; Its solid execution of some unique racing mechanics and its extremely slick presentation make Shox another recommendable game in EA Sports' successful Big franchise.;
The Cameron Files: Pharaoh's Curse Review;5.1;Mediocre; Apart from the hero's hairline, Pharaoh's Curse is a paint-by-numbers adventure game.;
Arx Fatalis Review;8.4;Great; With Arx Fatalis, Arkane Studios intended to pay homage to the classic early-'90s first-person role-playing game Ultima Underworld, but it has done much more than just imitate that game.;
WWE Raw Review;5.7;Mediocre; WWE Raw unfortunately does little to fill the wrestling void in PC gaming.;
Contra Advance: The Alien Wars EX Review;7.4;Good; Its graphics are nearly as impressive today as they were nearly 10 years ago, and the gameplay is nearly as exciting.;
The Elder Scrolls III: Tribunal Review;7.5;Good; When combined with the original game, Morrowind Tribunal's complementary features make an excellent role-playing game even better.;
ATV Offroad Fury 2 Review;7;Good; ATV Offroad Fury 2 makes a few incremental improvements to the existing ATV Offroad Fury formula.;
Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance Review;8.1;Great; Anyone looking for a wilder ride than the one offered by Tekken 4 or Virtua Fighter 4 should definitely check out Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.

Whirl Tour Review;6.5;Fair; There's really no shortage of games that pull off the action sports formula with more style and enthusiasm, making Whirl Tour somewhat irrelevant.;
Whirl Tour Review;6.5;Fair; There's really no shortage of games that pull off the action sports formula with more style and enthusiasm, making Whirl Tour somewhat irrelevant.;
Outlaw Golf Review;7.1;Good; Outlaw Golf is a deceptive game, because while its theme suggests fast-paced arcade-style golf, the actual gameplay really isn't like that at all.;
Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast Review;8.2;Great; The game's strong points--especially its combat--overshadow whatever problems Jedi Outcast may have early on.;
MechWarrior 4: Mercenaries Review;7.8;Good; Mercenaries is the perfect stand-alone sequel: improved enough for hard-core players, yet accessible enough for novices.;
FIFA 2003 Review;8.6;Great; No soccer fan should hesitate to buy FIFA 2003.;
Activision Anthology Review;7.3;Good; Anyone with an interest in classic gaming will find plenty of reasons to pick up this compilation.;Video Producer/Shooter/Editor. Mass Consumer of Television &amp
FIFA 2003 Review;8.6;Great; No soccer fan should hesitate to buy FIFA 2003.;

Rocky Review;5.5;Mediocre; Unfortunately, Rocky is completely spoiled by a few major problems.;
Rocky Review;5.5;Mediocre; Unfortunately, Rocky is completely spoiled by a few major problems.;
Unreal Championship Review;8.5;Great; Unreal Championship is a great game that is filled with action-packed, bloody shootouts that are especially fun online, but it lacks polish in a few spots.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Hunter: The Reckoning Review;7.7;Good; If you're looking for a quick fix of heavy action and a fun multiplayer game, then Hunter: The Reckoning is definitely worth it.;

Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Review;8.6;Great; Splinter Cell is a great game on its own merits, and it offers a slick and rewardingly suspenseful gameplay experience that's sometimes reduced to frustrating bouts of trial and error.;
FIFA 2003 Review;8.6;Great; No soccer fan should hesitate to buy FIFA 2003.;
Sonic Mega Collection Review;7.2;Good; It's true that the inclusion of even more Sonic games would have added a lot, but there's still a ton of gameplay to be found in Sonic Mega Collection.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4 Review;8.8;Great; It doesn't quite make Tony Hawk 3 obsolete, but rather gives the handheld crowd yet another excellent action sports game to choose from.;
Phantom Crash Review;7.5;Good; It looks like your average mech combat game at first glance, but is actually quite impressive in certain areas.;
Medal of Honor Frontline Review;8.5;Great; The game's level and mission design are extremely well done and provide an ample amount of different activities, keeping the gameplay fresh from start to finish.;

Medal of Honor Frontline Review;8.4;Great; The game's level and mission design are extremely well done and provide an ample amount of different activities, keeping the gameplay fresh from start to finish.;
Spyro: Enter the Dragonfly Review;2.8;Terrible; Even the biggest fans of Spyro are going to have a hard time enjoying this game.;
Serious Sam Review;8.5;Great; The Xbox version retains the original games' off-the-chart intensity levels, and Serious Sam--which was always an arcade game at heart--feels right at home on Microsoft's powerful console.;
Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2003 Review;9.1;Superb; Tiger Woods 2003 is prettier, more exciting, and more involving than any other golf game on the market and can rightfully claim its place alone at the top of the ...;
G.I. Combat: Episode 1: Battle of Normandy Review;3;Bad; G.I. Combat might realistically model the chaos and confusion of a real-world skirmish, but it's hardly playable.;
Big Air Freestyle Review;4.3;Poor; With games like MX Superfly and Freekstyle already on the market, there's simply no reason to give Big Air Freestyle a second look.;
Pro Rally Review;5.4;Mediocre; It's a frustrating game with a career mode that's too short, and, ultimately, you'd be better off without it.;
O.R.B. Review;7.5;Good; O.R.B. lacks inspiration, but it's a decent real-time strategy game for those who are tired of being confined to terra firma.;
Deadly Dozen: Pacific Theater Review;8.3;Great; It may be a little rough around the edges, but it's both exciting and technically impressive enough to stand up to its full-priced competition.;
NASCAR: Dirt to Daytona Review;8.1;Great; Dirt to Daytona is a sound NASCAR simulation with one of the most robust career modes of any driving game to date.;
Metroid Prime Review;9.7;Superb; It's not just one of the single most atmospheric games ever created, but it's also quite simply one of the best.;
Wreckless Review;5.6;Mediocre; Without the Xbox version's gorgeous visuals to distract from its weak gameplay mechanics and simplistic mission objectives, the PS2 version of Wreckless doesn't have much going for it.;
Robin Hood: The Legend of Sherwood Review;8.6;Great; An entertaining story, an impressive mission design, and a lively combat system have been brought together in such a way that the complete game works on nearly every level.;
Jet X2O Review;7.2;Good; The game is solid and doesn't fall short in any particular category, but it doesn't really make any improvements to the standard extreme racing formula, either.;
Wreckless Review;5.4;Mediocre; The poorly optimized GameCube version robs the original of most of its visual style and slows the pace considerably, resulting in a mediocre mission-based driving game with poor handling.;
Resident Evil 0 Review;8;Great; Those who have stuck with the Resident Evil series despite its dogged insistence on not changing its ways will find that Resident Evil 0 still has a lot to offer.;
Twisted Metal: Black Online Review;8.2;Great; If you buy a network adapter, take the time to send the card in for a fun and free copy of Twisted Metal: Black Online.;
Civilization III: Play the World Review;5;Mediocre; Hopefully, Play the World's wretched online performance can be fixed in a patch.;
Kakuto Chojin Review;5.5;Mediocre; While it offers some impressive production values, it ultimately seems shallow and incomplete, and it won't hold any fighting game player's attention for long.;
Medal of Honor Allied Assault: Spearhead Review;8.1;Great; You may have to decide whether or not a few hours of great single-player gaming and some new but not earth-shattering multiplayer features are worth 30 bucks.;
BMX XXX Review;5.4;Mediocre;" Aside from making the ""groundbreaking"" move of featuring a lot of cursing and strippers, BMX XXX doesn't do anything particularly well.";Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Zapper Review;6.6;Fair; Zapper delivers challenging action puzzle gameplay in a colorful, upbeat setting.;
EverQuest: The Planes of Power Review;7.9;Good; EverQuest: The Planes of Power serves as a reasonably good starting point for the game's continuous influx of new players but is mostly geared toward EverQuest's dedicated, hard-core following.;
Zapper Review;6.6;Fair; Zapper delivers challenging action puzzle gameplay in a colorful, upbeat setting.;
Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance Review;8.7;Great; Xbox owners who've never played Metal Gear Solid 2 will find in Substance a highly intriguing, original action game with some truly impressive production values.;
Cubivore Review;7.3;Good; As an offbeat conceptual piece, Cubivore is a must-have. As a game, it's slightly above average--an interesting combination of puzzle-solving and action that's plagued with camera issues.;
Rallisport Challenge Review;8.8;Great; Rallisport Challenge is an excellent game, and it can be wholeheartedly recommended to anyone interested in driving games.;
Dogs Playing Poker Review;6.5;Fair; Dogs Playing Poker might not be as clever or as funny as it could have been, but it's still a decent alternative to solitaire.;
BMX XXX Review;5.4;Mediocre; Aside from making the 'groundbreaking' move of featuring a lot of cursing and strippers, BMX XXX doesn't do anything particularly well.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
NBA Starting Five Review;4;Poor; Starting Five is a horrible train wreck of problems ranging from poor rebounding and passing to inconsistent shooting percentages and a worthless post-up game.;
Soldiers of Anarchy Review;8.1;Great; Despite its annoying technical issues, Soldiers of Anarchy is a lot of fun.;
Dynasty Warriors 3 Review;7.3;Good; Dynasty Warriors 3 is a good, solid beat-'em-up with enough variety to stay fresh throughout.;
WWE SmackDown! Shut Your Mouth Review;8.9;Great; If you're even a casual fan of the WWE, you can't go wrong with SmackDown! Shut Your Mouth.;
X-Men: Next Dimension Review;6.4;Fair; It can be a fine game to play with casual gamer friends who are fans of the source material, but a number of better fighting games starring the X-Men already ...;
Toxic Grind Review;3;Bad; With better BMX or action sports games already available on the Xbox, Toxic Grind is left out in the cold.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
MechAssault Review;9;Superb; If you're going to buy one game with your Xbox Live starter kit, MechAssault is the one to get.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Swingerz Golf Review;6.5;Fair; The game is very middle-of-the-road in most aspects of its execution.;
Shinobi Review;7.6;Good; Those looking for a game with lots of challenge and a distinct sense of style would do well to check out Shinobi.;
Project: Nomads Review;6.7;Fair; Though Project Nomads draws inspiration from some truly unique games, the game itself ends up being a fairly generic shooter.;
Gladiators of Rome Review;6.3;Fair; If you can get past its problems, you may find Gladiators of Rome to be a quirky strategy game that's interesting to play--at least for a little while.;
The Scorpion King: Rise of the Akkadian Review;4.2;Poor; The Scorpion King proves that the name of a popular movie and even the likeness of its star aren't nearly enough to make an otherwise bland game seem enjoyable.;
Disney Golf Review;7.3;Good; Though it's disappointing that the developer chose to spin its wheels rather than improve upon its past efforts, Disney Golf still stands up as a worthwhile arcade-inspired golf game.;
V-Rally 3 Review;7.2;Good; The only glaring mark against V-Rally 3 is its problematic control, but if you can see past this issue, then you'll likely enjoy this game.;
Beam Breakers Review;5.6;Mediocre; Though Beam Breakers does provide a few visceral thrills, it's hard to recommend it to anyone other than someone who is desperately hungry for some futuristic racing.;
FIFA 2003 Review;9.1;Superb; It isn't quite perfect, but the latest FIFA game is a refreshing and compelling step ahead in a series that's known for its quality.;
NBA Inside Drive 2003 Review;7.6;Good; The extra options, especially the franchise mode, succeed in giving Inside Drive 2003 the longevity that Inside Drive 2002 lacked, and the refinements to the gameplay make it more entertaining.;
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring Review;5.5;Mediocre; The Fellowship of the Ring is better left as a rental, even for die-hard fans of the original work.;
Ratchet & Clank Review;9;Superb; Ratchet & Clank skillfully avoids most of the traps that hold back the majority of modern platform games and presents a fantastic, well-balanced, story-driven adventure.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Strike Fighters: Project 1 Review;6.6;Fair; Strike Fighters might be the only game that has ever been released twice in an unfinished state.;
TransWorld Snowboarding Review;7.6;Good; TransWorld Snowboarding is an all-around solid game with some spectacular visuals and fun multiplayer modes.;
Sneakers Review;3;Bad; The game's cutesy hook might be enough for the young ones, but anyone with a modicum of gaming experience will probably find Sneakers to be boring and tedious.;

U.S. Special Forces: Team Factor Review;4.6;Poor; Team Factor couldn't have been released at a worse time.;

Prisoner of War Review;7;Good; The suspenseful sneaking gameplay and strong dose of character interaction make Prisoner of War a game that's by all means different from most others out there.;
ATV Quad Power Racing Review;5;Mediocre; Although no single aspect of this game is terrible, the overall package is unquestionably dull and limited.;
Blinx: The Time Sweeper Review;6.3;Fair; Blinx has some good ideas, and you won't finish it in a sitting, but that's not much consolation from a game that's a lot more frustrating than fun.;

Incoming Forces Review;6.6;Fair; Though it's certainly not bad, Incoming Forces isn't likely to inspire much excitement in anyone.;

Superman: Shadow of Apokolips Review;6.4;Fair; Superman: Shadow of Apokolips is just an average action game.;
Stronghold: Crusader Review;8;Great; Firefly Studios has polished up its old game nicely and has sent it on a long road trip into the Crusades.;
4x4 EVO 2 Review;4.8;Poor; It may be the first off-road racing game on the GameCube, but 4x4 EVO 2 is hardly representative of the best of what the genre has to offer.;

Sega Bass Fishing Duel Review;7.2;Good; Bass Fishing Duel is a solid-playing game that simply doesn't look that great.;Video Producer/Shooter/Editor. Mass Consumer of Television &amp
Divine Divinity Review;8.6;Great; There's much more to Divine Divinity than its impressive graphics and music and its combination of hack-and-slash action and pure role-playing, and that says a lot for the game.;
The Scorpion King: Rise of the Akkadian Review;4;Poor; The Scorpion King proves that the name of a popular movie and even the likeness of its star aren't nearly enough to make an otherwise bland game seem enjoyable.;
No One Lives Forever 2: A Spy In H.A.R.M.'s Way Review;9.3;Superb; No One Lives Forever 2 is a rousing success on every level.;
Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex Review;5.1;Mediocre; Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex on the GameCube is a perfunctory port of a perfunctory game.;

Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus Review;7.8;Good; The game's relative ease combined with a very short length prevents Sly Cooper from becoming the next big platformer. But it's great while it lasts.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.

Demolition Derby and Figure 8 Race Review;4.4;Poor; Demolition Derby is a strangely subdued affair that tends to make even the most horrific head-on collision seem bland.;
Arthur's Quest: Battle for the Kingdom Review;1.9;Abysmal; Arthur's Quest is either an action game with an exceedingly poor design, or a fast-paced, arcade-style coward simulator.;
Kelly Slater's Pro Surfer Review;8;Great; It's a very strong start for the surfing genre on Nintendo's system, and a unique and enjoyable extreme sports game in its own right.;

Sega Soccer Slam Review;8.3;Great; Anyone looking for a fast-paced arcade-style game of soccer would still do well to check out Sega Soccer Slam.;
Gungrave Review;5.1;Mediocre; Gungrave definitely looks cool. It's also a textbook case for why great graphics don't do you much good if the underlying game is shallow.;

Chessmaster 9000 Review;7.6;Good; If you're looking to pick up your first chess simulation, the decision is simple: no other product delivers the ease of use and instructional value of Chessmaster 9000.;

The Thing Review;8.4;Great; When you look at everything the game offers in terms of its gameplay, presentation, and story, it's hard not to appreciate The Thing.;
Icewind Dale II Review;8.3;Great; Like its predecessor, Icewind Dale II is simply a great role-playing game.;
Turok: Evolution Review;7.3;Good; It's formulaic but done well enough, so if you're into the previous installments or looking for another first-person shooter, then you'll find something to like in it.;
Turok: Evolution Review;7.3;Good; If you can withstand the surprisingly hard difficulty level, you'll find that Turok: Evolution is actually quite a good side-scroller.;
Farscape: The Game Review;3.5;Bad; Instead of drawing from the rich source material of the TV show, Farscape is a conventional action game with a clunky interface and a dated engine.;
Mobile Suit Gundam: Federation vs. Zeon Review;7.4;Good; Mobile Suit Gundam: Federation vs. Zeon is easily one of the most enjoyable Gundam games to date.;
Turok: Evolution Review;7;Good; It's more of the same, but the rehash is executed well enough that it should prove entertaining to fans of the series.;
The Partners Review;5.9;Mediocre; It's an interesting attempt to create a soap opera with The Sims as a model, but the fact is, The Sims was already a great little soap opera on its ...;
Emperor: Rise of the Middle Kingdom Review;7.7;Good; Emperor is a fun and satisfying management game, but it is primarily the same fun and satisfying management game as those that have preceded it.;

Super Shot Soccer Review;6.5;Fair; Super Shot Soccer is a pretty fun game that's a little short on options but not bad on offering up some well-rounded soccer gameplay.;
Space HoRSE Review;6.6;Fair; If you just want a way to play classic M.U.L.E. on your computer with three friends, Space HoRSE is a good purchase and is perhaps even a bargain.;

Commandos 2: Men of Courage Review;7.5;Good; It can't be recommended over the PC version, let alone wholly recommended in its own right, except to those looking for an extremely tough PS2 action strategy game.;
Season Ticket Football 2003 Review;1.8;Abysmal; A migraine-inducing interface and relentless number crunching makes for a program so needlessly complex that you can't bring yourself to call it a game.;
MLB Slugfest 2003 Review;8.1;Great; Midway's MLB Slugfest 2003 brings some good, clean fun back to a genre teeming with stodgy simulations.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Super Monkey Ball 2 Review;9;Superb; It's almost amazing how Super Monkey Ball 2 makes fun and addictive multiplayer gaming seem so simple, and it manages to include a compelling single-player game to boot.;

Strategic Command: European Theater Review;7.2;Good; It's a satisfying re-creation of the struggle that defined the 20th century. But because it lacks a challenging AI, it eventually falls apart as anything other than a multiplayer game.;
NCAA Football 2003 Review;8.5;Great; To put it simply, EA Sports' NCAA Football 2003 is a college football fan's dream.;
Soccer Mania Review;4.6;Poor; Soccer Mania is geared towards children, but that doesn't excuse the problems with its controls, loading times, and slowdown.;
Operation Flashpoint: Resistance Review;8.1;Great; A dual focus on immersion and complex military action returns in force with Operation Flashpoint: Resistance, a large and entertaining expansion pack for the original game.;

Shifters Review;3.9;Bad; Shifters was clearly not given enough time in development, and it isn't fun to play as a result.;
Barbarian Review;5.9;Mediocre; Uninteresting characters, a poor storyline, and some problems with its gameplay mechanics serve to bring Barbarian down.;
Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos Review;9.3;Superb; It's just an outstanding game, filled with all the charm, all the detail, and all the lasting appeal that characterizes all of the finest games ever made.;
Downforce Review;7.2;Good; It's too bad that Downforce is as simple as it is. It's a very fun game to play, but there really isn't much to it.;
Pac-Man All-Stars Review;5;Mediocre; Pac-Man All-Stars simply isn't very fun.;
Dinotopia: The Timestone Pirates Review;5.8;Mediocre; If you've read and enjoyed the novels that the game is based on, or you're looking for a game for a younger gamer, Dinotopia can be a worthy choice.;Video Producer/Shooter/Editor. Mass Consumer of Television &amp
NASCAR Heat 2002 Review;4;Poor; The dated graphics and the surprisingly inept gameplay make for a bad combination that dooms the game to mediocrity.;

Operation Blockade Review;3.6;Bad; If you were to buy, install, and actually enjoy Operation Blockade, you'd need to be at least partially insane.;
Scooby-Doo: Night of 100 Frights Review;7.3;Good; Scooby-Doo: Night of 100 Frights is a good game and an excellent re-creation of a cherished cartoon.;
MLB Slugfest 2003 Review;8.1;Great; Midway's MLB Slugfest 2003 brings some good, clean fun back to a genre teeming with stodgy simulations.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Freekstyle Review;8;Great; While it's not the motocross equivalent of SSX, EA Sports Big's first excursion on dirt is worth a look for those who enjoy a stiff challenge.;

Mega Man Battle Network 2 Review;8.5;Great; Mega Man Battle Network 2 retains the spirit of the Mega Man series and polishes the innovative gem that was the previous game even further.;
Wipeout Fusion Review;7.3;Good; Wipeout fans should definitely give Fusion at least a rental, though they should prepare themselves for some bittersweet nostalgia.;
Sky Gunner Review;7.2;Good; It plays really well a lot of the time, and the game itself is action-packed and interesting enough to warrant looking past its problems.;
The Worst Case Scenario Survival Trivia Challenge Review;5.8;Mediocre; The Worst Case Scenario Survival Trivia Challenge is easy to learn and play, and it will entertain you for 10 or 15 minutes at a time.;
Age of Wonders II: The Wizard's Throne Review;8.8;Great; Though it may seem difficult for beginners, Age of Wonders II sounds good, looks great, plays terrific, and improves on every aspect of the original game.;
MX Superfly Review;7.9;Good; It's the GameCube's first motocross game, and it's a pretty solid first attempt at the sport on Nintendo's console.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Bomberman MAX 2 Blue/Red Advance Review;7.3;Good; On its own merits, Bomberman MAX 2 is a fun adventure game with a decent collecting aspect and a few fun minigames.;
Legion: Legend of Excalibur Review;3.8;Bad; Legion has many sound concepts, but just about everything falls apart in the execution, resulting in a game that runs the gamut from frustrating to just plain terrible.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Pryzm Chapter One: The Dark Unicorn Review;5.5;Mediocre; Younger players are more likely to enjoy the simplistic and predictable gameplay that Pryzm offers.;
F1 2002 Review;8;Great; F1 2002's improvements on last year's game are marginal at best, and for some, that won't be enough to justify its $50 price tag.;
Fire Blade Review;7.6;Good; Fire Blade is a surprisingly good game that will more than satisfy helicopter combat fans.;
Monster Jam: Maximum Destruction Review;4.6;Poor; Monster Jam: Maximum Destruction can best be described as a poor version of Twisted Metal: Black.;
Gore: Ultimate Soldier Review;6.3;Fair; Gore is a decent shooter, but there isn't anything here that hasn't been done already--and better--in a game you probably already own.;
Elite Forces: Navy SEALs Review;3.1;Bad; Previous budget-priced shooters didn't set our expectations for Navy SEALs very high, but the game undercuts even those standards.;
Extreme Paintbrawl 4 Review;2.4;Terrible; The best thing you can say about its poor graphics and sound is that they weren't wasted on an otherwise great game.;
Endgame Review;5.7;Mediocre; People without a passion for shooting fake guns at their television sets probably won't find much to like.;
Outlaw Golf Review;7.1;Good; Outlaw Golf is an odd game because it has a theme that seems to appeal to a certain audience, yet the gameplay isn't really for that crowd.;
Dropship: United Peace Force Review;7.9;Good; It's an altogether unique flight combat game, and one that can also be quite impressive from a technological standpoint.;
The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind Review;8;Great; Morrowind is the first RPG for the Xbox, and it's absolutely huge, which is both the most amazing thing about it and also the thing that means it's not the ...;Morrowind is the first RPG for the Xbox, and it's absolutely huge, which is both the most amazing thing about it and also the thing that means it's not the game for everybody.
Bomberman Generation Review;8;Great; Surprisingly addictive and deceptively clever, Bomberman Generation has gotten the series back on track.;
Big Biz Tycoon Review;5.8;Mediocre; In trying to walk the line between being a virtual-life game and a business management game, Big Biz Tycoon limits itself to mediocrity.;
Legion Review;5.9;Mediocre; Though Legion doesn't have a lot of superfluous details, it also lacks the essential elements that make strategy games with authentic settings so appealing.;
Uncommon Valor: Campaign for the South Pacific Review;7.8;Good; Uncommon Valor takes much time to fathom, but after that time is over, you'll end up enjoying it.;
Power Play Sports Trivia PsX Review;4.9;Poor; Power Play Sports Trivia is about as no-frills as a PlayStation game can get these days.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Way of the Samurai Review;7.1;Good; Those expecting Way of the Samurai to be the next Tenchu or Bushido Blade will come away disappointed, but all others should find the game pretty entertaining, warts and all.;
Space Race Ps2 Review;5.9;Mediocre; Space Race probably wasn't the best game to port to the PS2 untouched, though Looney Tunes fans ought to give it a look.;
Baseball Mogul 2003 Review;6.1;Fair; What was once groundbreaking is now mundane, since this new sports management game remains largely unchanged from what was so refreshing five years ago.;
ZooCube Review;7.3;Good; ZooCube is a thoroughly entertaining puzzle game that can be quite a bit of fun for anyone able to grasp its three-dimensional nature.;
Test Drive Ps2 Review;6.9;Fair; It's fun for a while, but it's too arcadelike for its own good, and it really only lends itself to short amounts of time spent playing.;
Lost Kingdoms Review;7.1;Good; It's quite short and doesn't look or sound particularly good. You can tell that most of the effort went into the combat system.;
WrestleMania X8 Review;7.6;Good; If you're looking for a fun wrestling game for the GameCube, then you'll definitely want to check out WrestleMania X8.;
Test Drive Xbox Review;6.9;Fair; It's fun for a while, but it's too arcadelike for its own good, and it really only lends itself to short amounts of time spent playing.;
Zoo Tycoon: Dinosaur Digs Expansion Pack Review;6.4;Fair; It's a great idea for an expansion pack that unfortunately doesn't breathe enough new life into Zoo Tycoon to appeal to anyone but die-hard fans.;
Legends of Wrestling Review;5.3;Mediocre; Legends of Wrestling sadly doesn't follow through with a game that's as good as its concept.;
Virtua Striker 2002 GameCube Review;5.5;Mediocre; Virtua Striker 2002 has plenty of gameplay options to keep you busy. Unfortunately, its poor gameplay renders all of these modes nearly worthless.;
Ultimate Fighting Championship: Throwdown (PS2) Review;7.6;Good; If you haven't played any of the UFC games before, or if you've been waiting for the series to come to the PlayStation 2, then Throwdown makes a fine introduction.;
Lethal Skies Elite Pilot: Team SW Review;8;Great; Sammy's Lethal Skies Elite Pilot: Team SW has survived localization and emerges as an altogether impressive combat flight sim.;
Duke Nukem: Manhattan Project Review;7.9;Good; Manhattan Project is occasionally frustrating, but when it's good, it's very, very good.;
World Series Baseball Review;7.4;Good; While there is no denying that World Series Baseball offers a lot of options off the field, some additional on-field gameplay elements should have been included.;
Legends of Wrestling Review;5.3;Mediocre; Legends of Wrestling sadly doesn't follow through with a game that's as good as its concept.;
Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones Review;3.7;Bad; Certainly, there are worse games sitting on the store shelf. But not many.;
Hired Team: Trial Gold Review;3.5;Bad; Hired Team: Trial Gold has arrived at about the worst possible time.;
Spy Hunter GBA Review;6.2;Fair; Spy Hunter is an easygoing vehicular combat game with a few unfortunate flaws. But it sure is pretty.;
The Sum of All Fears Review;7.2;Good; While it's clear that The Sum of All Fears was rushed for the movie's release, it's a surprisingly solid game.;
Soldier of Fortune II: Double Helix Review;8.3;Great; It retains and improves upon virtually every element of the original, both in its single-player campaign and in its multiplayer mode.;
Hunter: The Reckoning Review;8;Great; Hunter succeeds in delivering a very fun though short gaming experience, whether you're playing alone or with up to three friends.;
Atari Revival review;5.2;Mediocre; These remakes don't look that great or play that well, but at least you get all three of them for $20.;
MotoGP Review;8.5;Great; THQ's MotoGP for the Xbox is the latest game that attempts to re-create the sport of Moto Grand Prix motorcycle racing, and for the most part, it does a very ...;
R/C Helicopter Indoor Flight Simulation Review;4;Poor; It's something to goof around with when you have 10 minutes to kill, but if you want any more than that, you should look elsewhere.;
Aggressive Inline Review;8.8;Great; It takes the gameplay and design concepts that have worked well in past alternative sports games and gives them enough of a face-lift to make the game feel new.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Medal of Honor Frontline Review;9;Superb; Medal of Honor Frontline is one of those games that will surprise PlayStation 2 owners by dazzling them with terrific gameplay, visual flair, and some of the best sound yet ...;
Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds: Clone Campaigns Expansion Pack Review;6.4;Fair; Battlegrounds brought to life the epic sweep of battles in the Star Wars universe, but this expansion pack doesn't add much to that epic sweep.;
Grand Theft Auto III Review;9.3;Superb; Grand Theft Auto III is a faithful port of a truly exceptional game.;
Warbirds III Review;8;Great; There's no denying that Warbirds is at once the most difficult, expensive, and ultimately gratifying online flight sim currently available.;
Jedi Starfighter Review;7;Good; While it's not the prettiest Xbox game out there, let alone the best-looking Star Wars game, it does offer good control and entertaining gameplay.;
2002 FIFA World Cup Review;6.8;Fair; FIFA 2002 is still the better soccer game for the PlayStation--unless you're a World Cup fanatic.;
Crisis Team: Ambulance Driver Review;1.4;Abysmal; Ambulance Driver is a horrible mistake of a game that should never have been made.;
The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind Review;8.7;Great; It's a beautiful, sprawling, and open-ended game that lets you play pretty much however you like as long as you're willing to fill in a few blanks using your imagination.;
Combat Medic: Special Ops Review;4.2;Poor; Combat Medic probably wasn't the best idea for a game.;
Britney's Dance Beat Review;6.9;Fair; Britney's Dance Beat can actually provide an enjoyable if short-lived experience, and it serves as a good introduction for the uninitiated to the world of rhythm games.;
Headhunter Review;7.7;Good; Its graphics fall short of the best the console has to offer, but its blend of action, stealth, and driving manages to keep things interesting throughout.;
Blender Bros. Review;7.4;Good; If you enjoy good 2D platform games, you can't go wrong with this one.;Video Producer/Shooter/Editor. Mass Consumer of Television &amp
Smashing Drive Review;3.5;Bad; Smashing Drive has virtually no lasting value whatsoever and just isn't much fun to play even as long as it lasts.;
Dragon Ball Z: The Legacy of Goku Review;5.4;Mediocre; Fans of the series will enjoy the subject matter and lengthy list of cameo appearances, but devout RPG players won't find anything to sink their teeth into.;
Dance Dance Revolution Konamix Review;6.9;Fair; Though it's as technically sound as the original DDR, Konamix is much harder to recommend, partly because it's more of the same, and partly because of the subpar music selection.;
The Italian Job Review;7.3;Good; Although The Italian Job doesn't have much longevity, its madcap subject matter, good presentation, and friendly control scheme will appeal to many people.;
Dragon Throne: Battle of Red Cliffs review;6.6;Fair; Dragon Throne is a decent enough game, but there are better real-time strategy games that you can spend your time and money on.;
Top Angler Review;4.1;Poor; At best, Top Angler is a pretty accurate simulation of what it's like to spend an entire day out on the lake and never have a single bite.;Video Producer/Shooter/Editor. Mass Consumer of Television &amp
World of Outlaws: Sprint Cars 2002 Review;6.7;Fair; World of Outlaws: Sprint Cars 2002 is clearly a game that will appeal to fans of the real-life motorsport.;
Tactics Ogre: The Knight of Lodis Review;9.1;Superb; The gameplay of Tactics Ogre truly shines, and the Game Boy Advance is a capable platform for it.;
2002 FIFA World Cup Review;8.8;Great; 2002 FIFA World Cup is quite simply one of the most exciting PC sports games ever created.;
Flanker 2.5 Review;8.5;Great; There is no other contemporary jet sim as complete, polished, and faithful to its subject matter as Flanker 2.5.;
Ski Park Manager Review;5.4;Mediocre; What is otherwise an enjoyable and challenging game is hidden beneath an unintuitive interface, questionable design decisions, compatibility issues, and an overall lack of polish.;
2002 FIFA World Cup Review;7.4;Good; If you already own FIFA 2002, then there really isn't any reason to own 2002 FIFA World Cup, and if you don't own FIFA 2002 but are looking for a ...;
Casino Mogul Review;6.4;Fair; Its good premise is almost enough to outweigh its frustrating design flaws.;
Tactical Ops: Assault on Terror Review;6.2;Fair; Looked at as a free mod, Tactical Ops is an achievement its developers can be proud of, but taken as a retail game, it still needs more work.;
Season Ticket Baseball 2003 Review;8.4;Great; There is no better sports management sim available on this side of the Atlantic.;
BCT Commander Review;7;Good; BCT Commander in many ways delivers exactly what it claims to--it's a rigorous, realistic simulation of what it's like to command a brigade of combined-arms troops in modern warfare.;
Gauntlet Dark Legacy Review;5.1;Mediocre; The game's extremely dated appearance and poor performance keep it from competing with other four-player Xbox games.;
Burnout Review;7.3;Good; There's enough meat on Burnout's bones to provide an engaging, albeit unoriginal, take on arcade racing.;
Burnout Review;7.3;Good; Burnout is a run-of-the-mill arcade driving game that features spectacular crashes.;
Resident Evil Review;8.9;Great; Anyone with a penchant for the macabre will be blown away by Resident Evil, and even if you're only vaguely into this sort of game, it's still a must buy.;
Ice Age Review;3.3;Bad; Ice Age is a straightforward platform game with a host of problems that ultimately make it a completely joyless experience.;Video Producer/Shooter/Editor. Mass Consumer of Television &amp
2002 FIFA World Cup Review;7.4;Good; The game lacks many of the features found in FIFA 2002, making it difficult to recommend to anyone but World Cup fanatics.;

Factory Mogul Review;6.3;Fair; It has some charm, and the budget price is suited to the amount of fun it provides.;
2002 FIFA World Cup Review;8;Great; Anyone looking for an Xbox soccer game that plays well and looks nice would do well not to pass on 2002 FIFA World Cup.;
Spider-Man: The Movie Review;7.2;Good; Despite the rough edges, however, it is the Spider-Man character itself that makes Spider-Man: The Movie fun to play.;
The Operative: No One Lives Forever Review;4.6;Poor; Everything that's good about The Operative: No One Lives Forever is simply overshadowed by the frustration you are subjected to without having a quick save.;
Star X Review;6.8;Fair; Star X is a sight to be seen on the Game Boy Advance.;Video Producer/Shooter/Editor. Mass Consumer of Television &amp
TransWorld Surf Review;7.4;Good; It's unfortunate that PlayStation 2 owners have been shortchanged on this port of TransWorld Surf.;

Ultimate Ride Coaster Deluxe Review;7.7;Good; Coaster Deluxe is essentially just a slightly better version of the original Ultimate Ride.;

Donald Duck: Goin' Quackers Review;6.2;Fair; Donald Duck: Goin' Quackers is most definitely a kids' game, but there's enough going on in it that even older players could get a kick out of this simple yet ...;
The Scorpion King: Sword of Osiris Review;8;Great; Game players are naturally wary of movie-licensed video games, but The Scorpion King: Sword of Osiris doesn't need The Rock to be interesting.;
Breath of Fire II Review;7.7;Good; The lengthy quest offers a meaty challenge for RPG fans to get sucked into and a surprise or two to satisfy those who look for them.;
Rayman Rush Review;5.8;Mediocre; Rayman Rush certainly doesn't maintain the same level of quality as the main games in the Rayman series, but it can prove to be a decent diversion for a short ...;
Spider-Man: The Movie Review;7.4;Good; Spider-Man: The Movie executes the core elements of the Spider-Man experience well and, in particular, features some great outdoor levels.;
K-1 World Grand Prix 2001 Review;8;Great; IMPORT: Fans of the sport who are savvy in the ways of importing may want to think about importing what is by far the best iteration of the K-1 sport.;

Atari Anniversary Advance Review;8;Great; It's an excellent addition to the library of any gamer interested in classic games.;Video Producer/Shooter/Editor. Mass Consumer of Television &amp
Might and Magic IX Review;6.2;Fair; Might and Magic IX is the sort of game that can't please either longtime fans or series newcomers looking to get a role-playing fix.;
WWII: Desert Rats Review;7.3;Good; WWII: Desert Rats is a good example of a budget game done right.;
ESPN MLS ExtraTime 2002 Review;6.4;Fair; ESPN MLS ExtraTime 2002 for the Xbox can be thoroughly enjoyed by casual soccer game fans, but it just doesn't come close to being on the same level as competing ...;
Yu-Gi-Oh! Dark Duel Stories Review;6.2;Fair; Dark Duel Stories comes recommended to avid enthusiasts of the Duel Monsters card game.;
Spider-Man: The Movie Review;7.4;Good; Spider-Man: The Movie seems like a bigger and better version of previous Activision Spider-Man games, and for the most part, that's true.;
Spider-Man: The Movie Review;7.5;Good; It makes perfect sense that the core gameplay of Spider-Man: The Movie is similar to previous Spider-Man games--but that its graphics really show off what the Xbox can do.;
RedCard Soccer 2003 Review;7.8;Good; It goes into slightly more realistic territory without sacrificing the fun, easy-to-learn gameplay that most of Midway's sports games possess.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Wolfenstein 3D Review;5.6;Mediocre; The GBA version is a perfect conversion of the PC original, but that fact alone may limit its appeal.;

Motocross Maniacs Advance Review;6.2;Fair; Motocross Maniacs Advance offers just as much depth as the competition and is definitely worth taking a look at.;Video Producer/Shooter/Editor. Mass Consumer of Television &amp
Britney's Dance Beat Review;6.4;Fair; It's a decent music-inspired video game, but it's definitely less about music and rhythm than it is a platform to promote Britney Spears herself.;
Army Men: RTS Review;7.1;Good; Army Men: RTS does a good job of creating a real-time strategy game based on the classic line of plastic toys.;
Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex Review;6.4;Fair; Featuring no improvements to its PlayStation 2 cousin, The Wrath of Cortex for the Xbox simply toes the line.;
Carnivores: Cityscape Review;5.2;Mediocre; The combat is simply not very engaging, and since the combat is all there is, that's a real problem.;
Deus Ex: The Conspiracy Review;8.1;Great; From a technical standpoint, Deus Ex shows its age and the limitations of the PS2. But the underlying game is widely considered to be a classic, and with good reason.;
WTA Tour Tennis Review;6.9;Fair; A few key gameplay and graphical issues keep it from reaching the same level of quality as other tennis franchises.;
Warrior Kings Review;7.5;Good; Warrior Kings is a very good 3D real-time strategy game that could have been great.;
Hooters: Road Trip Review;2.5;Terrible; There are plenty of bubbly Hooters waitresses, but not much in terms of gameplay.;
Hitchcock: The Final Cut Review;5.8;Mediocre; The game bears no comparison to Hitchcock's world of paranoia, intrigue, and ugly deeds.;
High Heat Major League Baseball 2003 Review;6.1;Fair; The High Heat Major League Baseball series is aging fast, but the 2003 GBA iteration--largely due to its two-player mode--is still a decent baseball game.;
Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories Review;5.9;Mediocre; Being able to play with all the physical cards you own makes this game the ideal companion piece for avid collectors who want to see their cards duke it out ...;
Pirates: The Legend of Black Kat Review;7.8;Good; Pirates is, simply put, an endearing and well thought-out game.;
MotoGP Review;7.1;Good; The graphics are some of the best for a racing game on the Game Boy Advance, and the different modes should keep you busy on long trips.;
Dark Arena Review;6.5;Fair; Many of its little touches are quite impressive, but there are clearly more memorable shooters of its kind already available.;
Global Operations Review;8.1;Great; If you don't care about the single-player game, if you have a high-speed Internet connection, and if you can find a good server, then Global Operations is great.;
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 Review;9;Superb; If you have halfway decent reflexes and a gamepad, then you need to check out Tony Hawk 3. And if you don't have a gamepad, get one for it.;
Blood Omen 2 Review;7.6;Good; It's worth playing to those lonely for another vampire game or wanting a change of pace from all the first-person shooters.;
Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast Review;9;Superb; Jedi Outcast is simply one of the easiest games to recommend this year.;
Dungeon Siege Review;8.4;Great; Its polished interface, accessible gameplay, and exceptional graphics make Dungeon Siege a first-rate action RPG.;

ESPN MLS ExtraTime 2002 Review;6.3;Fair; ESPN MLS ExtraTime 2002 is suitable only for the most dedicated of Major League Soccer fans.;
Heroes of Might and Magic IV Review;8.8;Great; The Heroes formula clearly stands the test of time in Heroes IV and is every bit as enjoyable as it's ever been in previous games.;
Savage Skies Review;5.4;Mediocre; Savage Skies can be entertaining at times, so it's not bad. But its flaws generally outweigh its strengths.;
The Sims: Vacation review;8;Great; Vacation breathes enough life back into The Sims to make it interesting again, though it's really at its best when used with other expansion packs.;
Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Desert Siege Review;8;Great; It features some subtle but important improvements to the original gameplay that make Ghost Recon a more polished and enjoyable game as a whole.;
Mike Tyson Boxing Review;3.3;Bad; Mike Tyson Boxing is a boring, repetitive exercise in countering your opponent.;
The King of Fighters 2001 Review;8.7;Great; Spend some time with it and you'll eventually realize that it's one of the deepest, most technical 2D fighting games ever made.;
Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars Review;7;Good; Gamers who like their games action-oriented may find Broken Sword to be too slow, but patient folks who like a good story that continually unravels will be delighted by this ...;Video Producer/Shooter/Editor. Mass Consumer of Television &amp
SuperPower Review;4.2;Poor; SuperPower will please neither hard-core wargamers nor those just looking for an enjoyable way to conquer the world.;
World Rally Championship Review;8.5;Great; Players of all skill levels will enjoy World Rally Championship for what it is: a fun racing game with just the right amount of realism.;
Freedom Force Review;9;Superb; Even with its minor problems, Freedom Force is very easy to recommend--it's a superhero game that gets everything right.;
Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Rogue Spear Review;7;Good; The action is still there, and, even more surprisingly, so are many of the frills that make the experience feel genuine.;
Driven Review;6.2;Fair; If you're looking for a racing game that is easy to control but extremely difficult, Driven fits the bill.;
Monsters Inc. Review;5.5;Mediocre; There is an overabundance of item collection, switch flipping, crate smashing, and backtracking, ultimately turning what could have been a lighthearted romp into several hours of drudgery.;
Smash Court Tennis Pro Tournament Review;7.2;Good; While Smash Court isn't quite as polished or deep as Virtua Tennis, there's still plenty of fun to be had with this game.;
Ultima Online: Lord Blackthorn's Revenge Review;6.7;Fair; Its uniqueness has allowed Ultima Online to boast an unprecedented record for commercial longevity, but the game is finally running out of steam.;
Blood Omen 2 Review (PlayStation 2) Review;7.4;Good; Blood Omen 2 is a fairly straightforward action adventure game, only with a lot more blood and a better main character than you'd normally find in such a game.;
Agent Under Fire Review;6.8;Fair; Agent Under Fire isn't a horrible game, but its lackluster level design, poor enemy AI, and easy level of difficulty pile up to greatly detract from what it does offer.;
Blood Omen 2 Review (Xbox) Review;7.6;Good; After playing Blood Omen 2 for the Xbox, you'll probably agree that one Legacy of Kain game--even if it isn't the best in the series--is better than none.;
High Heat Major League Baseball 2003 Review;6.2;Fair; High Heat 2003 is nearly a carbon copy of High Heat 2002 in the way it looks and plays, and its only serious addition to the series is an array ...;
Baseball Advance Review;8;Great; Its clever design and gorgeous visuals more than compensate for any deficiency.;
Agent Under Fire Review;6.8;Fair; Fans of GoldenEye 007 and other console first-person shooters will find Agent Under Fire a by-the-numbers FPS affair.;

ESPN NFL PrimeTime 2002 Review;3.6;Bad; Feeble gameplay makes PrimeTime unappealing, and the number of serious bugs that have come along for the ride make it completely unacceptable.;
Konami Collector's Series: Arcade Advanced Review;8.5;Great; The ability to play as Chain, Buchu, Star, Blues, and the rest of the Yie Ar Kung-Fu gang is enough on its own to make this cart a must-have.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Herdy Gerdy Review;6.8;Fair; Another five or six months in the cooker and Herdy Gerdy could have really been something special.;
Bloody Roar: Primal Fury Review;7.2;Good; Bloody Roar: Primal Fury may not be representative of the sophisticated side of the fighting game genre, but it certainly looks great, and it can be fun.;
Diggles Review;6.3;Fair; Lethargic gameplay makes Diggles much less than the sum of its parts.;
Gauntlet: Dark Legacy Review;5.1;Mediocre; The game's extremely dated appearance and poor performance keep it from competing with other four-player GameCube games.;
NBA 2K2 Review;8.6;Great; NBA 2K2 may have been a long time coming to the GameCube, but as the saying goes, good things come to those who wait.;
Triple Play 2002 Review;8.6;Great; The game's great graphics, involving gameplay, and great commentary all blend together to deliver an exciting and authentic game of baseball.;
Mr. Mosquito Review;6.4;Fair; Mister Mosquito is a thoroughly original title that brings to a new audience, through parody, a touch of what makes Japanese culture so appealing to so many Westerners.;
Home Run King Review;7.1;Good; Home Run King is supposed to be an over-the-top arcade sports game, but nothing could be farther from the truth.;
Mad Maestro! Review;6.3;Fair; While the game is both quirky and Japanese, it simply isn't compelling or challenging enough to really engage its target audience of hard-core rhythm gamers.;
Triple Play 2002 Review;8.6;Great; The game's great graphics, involving gameplay, and great commentary all blend together to deliver an exciting and authentic game of baseball.;
Spy Hunter Review;6.7;Fair; While it's almost identical to the PlayStation 2 version, the GameCube version is made slightly less desirable by the choppy, somewhat pixilated graphics.;
Golf Resort Tycoon II Review;6.8;Fair; The 3D golf mode adds an interesting and fun twist to what would have otherwise been a straightforward management strategy game.;
Sega Soccer Slam Review;8.6;Great; Sega Soccer Slam sets the bar by which any other soccer games of this type will be judged.;
Out of the Park Baseball 4 Review;8.4;Great; The game is a remarkable simulation of running a big-league franchise from the front office to the field.;
Gunvalkyrie Review;6.2;Fair; Gunvalkyrie is almost a good game, and it won't be surprising to see some people looking past the game's problems and having some fun with it.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
NFL Blitz 2002 Review;8.5;Great; NFL Blitz 2002 is the best arcade-style football game on the home market and makes an excellent alternative for those who haven't been wowed by the Xbox's other football offerings.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Strange Adventures in Infinite Space Review;7.4;Good; Strange Adventures is an addictive little game that you can lose yourself in for a few minutes at a time.;
Crash Bandicoot: The Huge Adventure Review;7.4;Good; Crash Bandicoot: The Huge Adventure is a worthy addition to the series.;
Pac-Man World 2 Review;7.9;Good; Pac-Man World 2 is a great platform game overall, one that anybody who's into the lighthearted style of the game would do well to check out.;
Dark Planet: Battle for Natrolis Review;5.6;Mediocre; Many of Dark Planet's problems have been solved in other real-time strategy games, so it's disappointing to find them marring what should have been a better game.;
Virtua Fighter 4 Review;9.3;Superb; You can't tell right off the bat, but Virtua Fighter 4 is the best fighting game in years.;

All-Star Baseball 2003 Review;8.6;Great; All-Star Baseball 2003 has High Heat 2003 licked where graphics are concerned, and the inclusion of the franchise mode makes Acclaim's hardball simulation all the more enticing.;
Star Trek Bridge Commander Review;8.2;Great; Totally Games has managed to accurately translate the slow-paced tactical battles of the Star Trek universe into an interesting game.;
Real Pool 2 Review;5.5;Mediocre; Real Pool 2 may offer pretty graphics, but it comes up short in so many other areas that it cannot be heartily recommended.;

Shadow Force: Razor Unit Review;4.6;Poor; You mainly run around 10 bland variations of a single desert level while shooting at the same two enemies.;
Sled Storm Review;7.6;Good; Sled Storm uses the SSX formula well, and anyone who enjoys a challenging arcade-style racer should have fun with the game.;
Trainz Review;8.7;Great; If you've ever been captivated by the romance of the rails or have perhaps thought of dabbling in model railroading, Trainz could easily make an enthusiastic convert of you.;
All-Star Baseball 2003 Review;8;Great; If you're looking for a simulation-style baseball game for your GameCube, All-Star Baseball 2003 is the best and only option.;
Spy Hunter Review;6.7;Fair; For the most part, it makes good on the PlayStation 2 version, but it's dragged down by somewhat problematic graphics.;
Fatal Frame Review;7.1;Good; If games such as Silent Hill and Resident Evil interest you, this should be right up your alley.;
Zone of the Enders: The Fist of Mars Review;7.3;Good; Although tactical combat is the focus of the title, Konami has infused an element of hands-on action into this competent, story-driven strategy RPG.;

Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 Review;9.5;Superb; Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 used to be the must-own action sports game for the Game Boy Advance. Meet the new titleholder.;

Salt Lake 2002 Review;6.3;Fair; Salt Lake is an entertaining yet brief whirl through just a fraction of the events you might expect.;
Circus Maximus Review;6.2;Fair; Actually competing in a deadly chariot race is an intriguing concept for a game, but Circus Maximus doesn't manage to make the experience all that exciting.;
Ecco the Dolphin: Defender of the Future Review;7.4;Good; The few gameplay quirks it has--specifically, its odd level design and occasionally spazzy camera--are more than made up for by its positive aspects.;
Eve of Extinction Review;6.5;Fair; Yuke's has taken the classic beat-'em-up gameplay and mixed it with the evil corporation motif, creating Eve of Extinction, a game with lofty aspirations but only moderate means.;
ESPN NBA 2Night 2002 Review;5;Mediocre; ESPN NBA 2Night 2002 really has nothing that would make it worth recommending over a number of other basketball games for the PlayStation 2.;

Jeremy McGrath Supercross World Review;2.4;Terrible; The game is a thoroughly bland cross between the simulation and arcade styles of MX games.;

NBA Jam 2002 Review;7;Good; Several problems ultimately keep NBA Jam 2002 from attaining all-star status. But all things considered, it's still a decent handheld rendition of two-on-two basketball.;

Sonic Adventure 2 Battle Review;6.8;Fair; The tedious collecting and shooting levels are made more frustrating by the game's uncooperative camera, and it's a shame that Sega's latest Sonic game has very little to do with ...;
World Tour Soccer 2002 Review;8.2;Great; If you demand more from gameplay than what the FIFA series is currently offering, World Tour Soccer 2002 is a wise choice.;

Puyo Pop Review;8.4;Great; The joy of Puyo Pop lies in its gameplay.;

Kao the Kangaroo Review;2.7;Terrible; It's not entirely unlike Nintendo's Super Mario World, except that it's significantly more dull and frustrating.;

Quarterback Club 2002 Review;5.5;Mediocre; Aside from the game's exceptional QB challenge mode, there isn't much that really stands out in Quarterback Club 2002.;
MX 2002 Featuring Ricky Carmichael Review;7.1;Good; The control is tight, the graphics are more than adequate, and the Xbox version's additional features make it as good a choice of motocross racer as any currently available today.;
Shaun Palmer's Pro Snowboarder Review;7.9;Good; It's Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 on snow--albeit with a few caveats.;

Martian Gothic: Unification Review;5.9;Mediocre; Martian Gothic: Unification does a decent job of blending explorative gameplay and third-person zombie fighting with a truly horrific story.;
Phalanx Review;7.8;Good; If you're into games like Gradius and Project S-11, and happen to possess twitch reflexes, Phalanx has your call sign, Ace.;

Fighting Legends Review;4;Poor; Fighting Legends could have used at least another year in development.;
ESPN International Winter Sports 2002 Review;5.2;Mediocre; ESPN International Winter Sports is a collection of 10 minigames that can be played solo or head-to-head--and little else.;
GoDai: Elemental Force Review;3.3;Bad; Despite some solid ideas and some very cool game mechanics, the game is technically flawed to a degree that's almost criminal.;
Jonny Moseley Mad Trix Review;2.9;Terrible; Virtually every technical and stylistic aspect of the game is either shoddily handled, or feels somehow incomplete.;
Fortress Europe Review;2.8;Terrible; Fortress Europe is a wretched underdone mess that has no business being sold in its current state.;

ESPN Winter X-Games Snowboarding 2002 Review;6.4;Fair; Konami's latest snowboarding excursion proves that realism doesn't always translate into fun.;
Cabela's Off-Road Adventure 2 Review;7;Good; Off-Road Adventure 2 is unlike virtually any previous driving game in that it does not force you to compete against other cars or a constantly ticking clock.;
Mech Platoon Review;8.3;Great; Although the Game Boy Advance is nowhere near as powerful as a PC, Mech Platoon compromises nothing compared with stalwart veterans like Starcraft or Command & Conquer.;
Alcatraz: Prison Escape Review;1.6;Abysmal; Alcatraz is a short, ugly, boring first-person sneaking game with a thick topcoat of bugs.;
Universal Studios Theme Park Adventure Review;3.5;Bad; The game is too frustrating and convoluted for kids to have any fun with it, and all but the most desperate adult GameCube fans will find it tedious and unentertaining ...;
Starships Unlimited: Divided Galaxies Review;8;Great; Starships Unlimited is a game that's as remarkable for its humble shareware beginnings as it is for its elegant design.;
Dragon Rage Review;4.1;Poor; Dragon Rage comes down to being a very basic shooter with a number of flaws thrown in at no extra cost.;
Mobile Suit Gundam: Zeonic Front Review;6.8;Fair; The amount of enjoyment you'll derive from Mobile Suit Gundam: Zeonic Front may be directly related to your love of the series.;

Wizardry: Tale of the Forsaken Land Review;8.5;Great; Wizardry: Tale of the Forsaken Land is easily one of the best PC-style role-playing games to ever grace a console.;
Conflict Zone Review;4.2;Poor; Spend five minutes playing Conflict Zone and you''ll understand why it should have stayed on the computer.;
Original War Review;5;Mediocre; While real-time strategy games have generally advanced far beyond 1995, Original War has actually regressed.;
Rez Review;7.9;Good;" On paper, UGA's ""music shooter"" may sound a little dull, but it's one of those games that simply must be seen--and in this case, heard--to be fully understood.";Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
NBA Courtside 2002 Review;7.6;Good; Despite the fact that it's a solid first-year effort, Courtside 2002 isn't without its flaws and is generally a step behind more seasoned competing products.;
Gunfighter: The Legend of Jesse James Review;4.6;Poor; While this light-gun game falls short more often than it succeeds, it does give a glimpse of what could be done within the settings of the wild Wild West.;
Mega Man Xtreme 2 Review;7;Good; It will certainly appeal to an audience eager for a serious challenge and more classic Mega Man action as well as those who might have been disappointed with the previous ...;
Monster Rancher Advance Review;8.4;Great; Previous games in the Monster Rancher series may have been grander in size or graphical splendor, but Monster Rancher Advance may be the greatest entry yet for a number of ...;
NCAA March Madness 2002 Review;7;Good; NCAA March Madness 2002 improves in gameplay terms upon its NBA counterpart, but even as a first-year effort, the options and features available in the game are rather paltry.;
Bloodwake Review;7.9;Good; Though not without drawbacks, Bloodwake is an entertaining game that could be a good start to a new series.;
Powerpuff Girls: Mojo Jojo-A-Go-Go Review;6.3;Fair; While the game can't be recommended as highly as the incredible cartoon it's based on, Powerpuff Girls: Mojo-Jojo A-Go-Go is a capable shooter in its own right.;
The Simpsons Road Rage Review;6.2;Fair; While it's better than the poor GameCube port of the original Crazy Taxi, ultimately, the only saving grace Road Rage has is that it's a Simpsons game.;
Lineage: The Blood Pledge Review;5.5;Mediocre; Lineage looks and plays like a much older game, and unless you can drum up some fake nostalgia, you most likely won't make it past the free trial period.;
Tsugunai: Atonement Review;4.1;Poor; Many of the interesting concepts in Tsugunai: Atonement lose their appeal shortly after the umpteenth quest to help some tortured soul in town.;
Deer Hunter 5: Tracking Trophies Review;6.3;Fair; It doesn't have much to distinguish it from Deer Hunter 4 aside from new locations, the hunting season, and the bot tourney.;
Giants: Citizen Kabuto Review;8.3;Great; Give Giants a try, and in short order, you'll find yourself playing one of the PS2's most likable, most offbeat shooters.;
Combat Review;6.8;Fair; Combat is a decent arcade-style shooter that should at least temporarily please newbies and anyone with an itchy trigger finger.;
Jade Cocoon 2 Review;8.1;Great; Jade Cocoon 2 is much better than its predecessor, retaining and improving on its predecessor's strengths, but it lacks that special something that makes it more than the sum of ...;
Uplink Review;7.1;Good; The thrill of poking your nose into places that it doesn't belong is certainly satisfied here, courtesy of an often smart design that turns every hack into a mystery waiting ...;
Mega Man X6 Review;7;Good; It's still Mega Man, and the gameplay is still entertaining, making X6 an attractive package for hard-core Mega Man fans.;
Master Rallye Review;7.9;Good; Master Rallye is an entertaining trucking thrill ride that walks a fine line between a realistic rally title and a wild 4x4 off-road racer.;
Breath of Fire Review;7.7;Good; Breath of Fire is an engaging piece of work that's worth checking out.;
Star Trek: Voyager Elite Force Review;6.2;Fair; Star Trek: Voyager Elite Force is a fairly by-the-book first-person shooter given depth by the Star Trek mythos.;
Star Wars: Obi-Wan Review;4.6;Poor; Something bad clearly happened when Obi-Wan was turned into an Xbox game.;
Hoshigami: Ruining Blue Earth Review;7.1;Good; For serious fans of the genre, the game can be very time consuming and rewarding in the way a good strategy game should be.;
Dig Dug: Deeper Review;4.5;Poor; Dig Dug Deeper's lack of difficulty, levels, and extra features make it difficult to recommend to even the most ardent fan.;
Batman: Vengeance Review;7.4;Good; There's nothing here that would warrant picking up this version if you already own the PlayStation 2 or GameCube editions, the Xbox version slightly edges out its brothers.;
NFL 2K2 Review;9.3;Superb; NFL 2K2 for the Xbox is marginally better looking than its PlayStation 2 counterpart, but it doesn't really take advantage of the Xbox's hardware.;
Fox Sports Football Review;7.9;Good; In spite of minor difficulties, Sorrent's Fox Sports Football is still a great mobile title and is the most realistic football action available for the cell.;
EverQuest: The Shadows of Luclin Review;8.4;Great; The Shadows of Luclin is easily the biggest, most significant EverQuest expansion yet, and considering the massive size of the other expansions, that's no small feat.;
American Bass Challenge Review;6.1;Fair; Fans of arcade-style fishing may turn their noses up at the complexity of the game, but in the end, this is a solid game that will satiate avid anglers.;Video Producer/Shooter/Editor. Mass Consumer of Television &amp
Mega Man Battle Network Review;8.3;Great; The game's battle system aptly captures the essence of Mega Man, and so does the colorful visual style.;
Great Outdoor Games Bass 2002 Review;6.9;Fair; Great Outdoor Games Bass 2002 from Konami is a fine example of how a game can be stripped down to its barest essentials and still be a great game.;Video Producer/Shooter/Editor. Mass Consumer of Television &amp
Namco Museum Review;6.8;Fair; This package contains the major hits that most fans are after.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Frank Herbert's Dune Review;3.3;Bad; It's a poorly designed 3D action-adventure game that actually has precious little to do with the source material and equally little to recommend it.;
Schizm Review;7.8;Good; Schizm has a thin story, but the puzzles were obviously created by and for people who love a daunting task.;
NHL 2002 Review;8.7;Great; Even though its graphics fail to take advantage of the Xbox hardware, its depth of modes is staggering, and the gameplay is predominantly tight.;
Secret Service: In Harm's Way Review;6.7;Fair; Secret Service has a lot of potential that's hampered by sloppy execution.;
SSX Tricky Review;8.8;Great; Tricky for the Xbox exhibits some the obvious signs of being a port but remains a highly addictive and entertaining experience.;
Larry Ragland 4x4 Challenge Review;4.9;Poor; The selection of similar yet superior games that are still widely available make 4x4 Challenge recommendable to practically no one.;
Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX Review;8.1;Great; The controls and general feel of Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX make it a satisfying product.;
Battlecruiser Millennium Review;6;Fair; It's a game that reaches for the stars, but in trying to give you everything, it doesn't do any one thing as well as it might.;
Driven Review;7.1;Good; The real fun of Driven is that it is so easy to play and yet so strategic in execution.;
Legend of Alon D'ar Review;3.5;Bad; Although it features reasonably unique character designs, interesting concepts, and a huge explorable world, Legend of Alon D'ar fails in execution with substandard quality in nearly every respect.;

Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX 2 Review;9.2;Superb; The GBA version of Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX 2 makes no compromises in re-creating the experience of its console cousins.;
Gothic Review;7.2;Good; Though it has an unusual story, lots of spoken dialogue, and a substantial amount of gameplay, it also has frustrating action sequences and some noticeable technical problems.;
The Simpsons Road Rage Review;6.2;Fair; While The Simpsons is often entertaining and enjoyable, The Simpsons Road Rage for the Xbox is not.;
Shadow Hearts Review;7.9;Good; Despite its considerable depth, Shadow Hearts is easy to get into and yet maintains a satisfying level of challenge.;
Monster Truck Rumble Review;3.2;Bad; Despite that it doesn't play terribly, Monster Truck Rumble really has nothing to offer.;
Capitalism II Review;8.5;Great; Once competition picks up against the aggressive AI, Capitalism II shows its colors as a great strategy game. Also, as if to help your own bottom line, the game's a ...;
Final Fantasy X Review;9.3;Superb; If you've been waiting for the definitive role-playing game for the PlayStation 2, here it is.;
Wario Land 4 Review;8.7;Great; If you're looking for a quality 2D platformer for your Game Boy Advance, look no further than Wario Land 4.;

Harvest Moon: Save the Homeland Review;8.1;Great; Harvest Moon: Save the Homeland is an engaging, long-lasting experience, and it may just be some of the most fun you can have on a lazy weekend afternoon.;
Tetris Worlds Review;2.1;Terrible; Tetris Worlds does what countless iterations of the game haven't managed to do in the past--it actually breaks Tetris.;
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone Review;4;Poor; No matter how much you care for the idea of flying on a broomstick or weaving fantastic magicks, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a lesson in boredom.;
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone Review;5.4;Mediocre; While visually and aurally sound, and at times impressive, Harry Potter's GBA debut is neither innovative nor particularly compelling from a gameplay perspective.;
Wave Rally Review;6.3;Fair; Wave Rally seems like a missed opportunity.;
Extreme-G 3 Review;8.6;Great; Those who waited for the GameCube version of Extreme-G 3 have been rewarded with a superior version of the game.;
S.W.I.N.E. Review;7.8;Good; While the gameplay isn't quite as unusual as the premise, S.W.I.N.E. is a solid real-time strategy game with plenty of humor, all wrapped up in a beautiful shell.;
Survivor Review;2;Terrible; If you're harboring even a tiny urge to buy this game, please listen very carefully to this advice: Don't do it.;
Gorasul: Legacy of the Dragon Review;6.4;Fair; Bugs and countless rough edges take a lot of the fun out of this fantasy role-playing game.;
Driven Review;2.9;Terrible; Innovative and unplayable are two wholly disparate adjectives, but they both apply to the PlayStation 2 version of Driven.;
Star Wars Starfighter: Special Edition Review;7.2;Good; Star Wars Starfighter: Special Edition manages to maintain the charm of the Lucas films and also deliver an entertaining foray into the Star Wars universe.;
Max Payne Review;8;Great; If you can't play this intense, original action game on any platform except the PS2, then that's where you should play it--but only by default.;
Max Payne Review;9.2;Superb; It's an outstanding and original action game that's not just different from all other shooters to date, but also in many ways superior.;
F1 2001 Review;8.2;Great; F1 2001 for the Xbox is a wholly satisfying racing game.;
Dynasty Warriors 3 Review;7.1;Good; Dynasty Warriors 3 offers lengthy replay value by allowing players to take up a number of roles on all three sides in the otherwise fixed campaign.;
Arctic Thunder Review;4;Poor; It's noticeably better looking than the lackluster PlayStation 2 version, but it still has its fair share of problems.;
Disney's Tarzan Untamed Review;6.2;Fair; This is a great game for children and perhaps for adults looking for a quick rental, but it's certainly not something you'd induct into your permanent collection.;
Rally Trophy Review;8.7;Great; If you enjoy this generally lonely style of driving, Rally Trophy will take you on a journey that ranks right up there with the best the racing genre has to ...;
ESPN NFL Primetime 2002 Review;5.5;Mediocre; The game's ESPN license can't hide the fact that NFL Primetime has slippery controls and flawed AI, which ultimately translates to a mediocre NFL simulation.;
Twisted Metal Small Brawl Review;6.5;Fair; It seems almost as if this game is SCEA's form of an apology to the fans, while at the same time an attempt to win over some of the younger ...;
Disney's Tarzan Untamed Review;5.9;Mediocre; Disney's Tarzan Untamed is a great game for children and perhaps for adults looking for a quick rental, but it's certainly not something you'd induct into your permanent collection.;
SSX Tricky Review;8.8;Great; SSX Tricky for the GameCube features little to no improvements on the PlayStation 2 version, but that doesn't keep it from being a blast to play.;
Pikmin Review;8.9;Great; One part dark struggle for survival and one part cute fairy tale, Pikmin is an engaging game with the twisted charm found in a good Tim Burton movie.;
Legends of Wrestling Review;5.3;Mediocre; The lack of match variety, the sloppy control, and the poor overall execution make Legends of Wrestling a rental at best.;
Comanche 4 Review;7.7;Good; In the Comanche series' fourth installment, NovaLogic has gone back to what it does best--making flight sims with as much bang-per-flight-minute as possible.;
NFL GameDay 2002 Review;6.8;Fair; After an anemic first-year effort on the PlayStation 2, it seems that with GameDay 2002, the series is finally back on track.;
IL-2 Sturmovik Review;9.2;Superb; IL-2 Sturmovik is destined to be a classic. This is one of those simulations that reminds you why you love the genre.;
Shenmue II Review;8.7;Great; IMPORT: It's a polished game that serves as a showcase for the DC and the evolution of the RPG genre, and fans should definitely find a way to play it.;
Silent Hill 2: Restless Dreams Review;7.9;Good; High expectations aside, you're still left with a sturdy game, whichever system you end up playing it on.;
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone Review;5.5;Mediocre; Ultimately, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone doesn't have the widespread appeal of its literary namesake and is suitable only for children.;
Soul Reaver 2 Review;8;Great; Those players familiar with the original Soul Reaver should have a good idea of what to expect from the sequel and its innovative blend of action and puzzle-solving.;
AquaNox Review;6.1;Fair; While the graphics are undeniably great, the battles are dull, and the awkward controls and extremely brief missions prevent AquaNox from being engrossing as an action game.;
Azurik: Rise of Perathia Review;5;Mediocre; If you already own an Xbox, don't bother picking up the game, and if you're considering buying an Xbox, don't judge the console by this game.;
Wizardry 8 Review;9.1;Superb; Its engaging gameplay and surprisingly good graphics and sound make it a worthy finale to the Wizardry series, as well as an excellent RPG in and of itself.;
Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy Review;8.8;Great; Next to Rayman 2, Jak and Daxter is the best 3D platformer available for the PlayStation 2.;
Etherlords Review;8.1;Great; Tedious strategy elements aside, Etherlords is the most successful attempt to combine the power of computer graphics with the dynamics of collectible card games.;
Beyond Atlantis II Review;7.4;Good; By abandoning almost all pretense of a coherent story, the designers have simply created a series of beautiful, interesting environments filled with some good puzzles.;
The Simpsons Road Rage Review;6.2;Fair; Ultimately, the only saving grace Road Rage has is that it's a Simpsons game.;
Mad Dash Racing Review;7;Good; Mad Dash Racing is a competent racing game, but its single-player gets pretty dull, especially once you've unlocked most of what the game has to offer.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Test Drive Off-Road Wide Open Review;6.8;Fair; Despite its rather humdrum graphics and sound, it manages to provide a thrilling experience for the first several hours.;
Codename: Outbreak Review;5.4;Mediocre; Aside from a few novelty options, Codename: Outbreak is an uninspired first-person shooter that really doesn't stack up against the glut of similar games currently out on the market.;
Jeremy McGrath Supercross World Review;2.4;Terrible; Gamers are advised to avoid this game, period.;
Sunny Garcia Surfing Review;5.9;Mediocre; The age of the engine is apparent, and the presentation and gameplay simply aren't up to par with those of more modern surfing games.;
Super Smash Bros. Melee Review;8.9;Great; Nintendo's spastic tribute to itself stands quite strong as one of the most engaging multiplayer games available for any console platform.;
Ecks vs. Sever Review;7.1;Good; Ecks vs. Sever is a good, solid game that gets the job done in a simple, effective way.;Video Producer/Shooter/Editor. Mass Consumer of Television &amp
FIFA 2002 Review;8.7;Great; The PlayStation version of FIFA 2002 doesn't quite have all the features available on the PlayStation 2, but it makes a solid case for an investment on its own.;
Europa Universalis II Review;8.5;Great; The new game has a broader focus, one that will interest returning veterans of the first game, and it greatly improves the tutorial and documentation to ease the significant learning ...;
FIFA 2002 Review;8.7;Great; Fans of soccer will find that this latest FIFA game is the most challenging, most realistic, and also the greatest yet.;
Batman: Vengeance Review;6.7;Fair; You might be better off playing games that are geared towards delivering one solid type of game, rather than taking four beaten paths.;
BackTrack Review;3.9;Bad; Thanks to a claustrophobic clipping plane and frequent dead zones, BackTrack still feels like unfinished shareware.;
Frequency Review;8.7;Great; Frequency claims the title of best rhythm game with ease and is a thoroughly enjoyable game in its own right.;
Takeda Review;5.5;Mediocre; Although Takeda is original, a combination of questionable design decisions and serious technical issues make it tough to play, let alone enjoy.;
Super Bust-A-Move Review;8;Great; This is the first handheld version of Bust-A-Move that's both playable and visually appealing.;
Kabuki Warriors Review;1.4;Abysmal; Kabuki Warriors is one of the worst games to be released this year or any year, on the Xbox or any other platform.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
NFL 2K2 Review;9.5;Superb; No other game truly delivers the feeling of literally catching a football, running through the line, or making that perfect throw better than NFL 2K2 does.;
Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance Review;8.8;Great; Those with open minds for a new experience and a penchant for delightfully slicing their enemies apart will find that Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance definitely delivers.;
Return to Castle Wolfenstein Review;9.2;Superb; Wolfenstein is well worth it for the multiplayer game alone, so the fact that you get a solid single-player game in the box can only be considered a bonus.;
Amped: Freestyle Snowboarding Review;6.7;Fair; While Amped: Freestyle Snowboarding is visually impressive and loaded with options, its technical merits are drastically undermined by its shoddy gameplay.;
Batman: Vengeance Review;7.4;Good; Batman: Vengeance succeeds at what it set out to do--it puts you into the role of Batman.;
Transworld Surf Review;8;Great; Transworld Surf is one of the best action sports titles in the Xbox launch lineup.;
Jackie Chan Adventures: Legend of the Dark Hand Review;8.3;Great; The lighthearted charm of Jackie himself really comes through via the story, and there's plenty of variety to keep a person occupied long after an initial run.;
Spyro: Season of Ice Review;7.5;Good; Once you're used to floating diagonally and hopping ledges toward loftier areas, the game becomes quite fun.;
Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX 2 Review;6.9;Fair; If you're looking for some BMX action, you could certainly do worse, but Acclaim and Z-Axis could certainly do better.;
WWF: Road to Wrestlemania Review;7.8;Good; For those who can overlook a little lack of polish, WWF: Road to Wrestlemania is an excellent addition to the wrestling enthusiast's game library.;
Star Trek: Armada II Review;7.1;Good; It probably won't completely satisfy those who enjoyed the first Star Trek: Armada, though with that caveat aside, it can still be recommended.;
NHL Hitz 2002 Review;7.2;Good; As the only hockey game available, NHL Hitz 2002 deserves a strong look from GameCube-owning pucks fans.;
Tennis Masters Series Review;5.9;Mediocre; Tennis Masters Series falls short because of its sluggish controls, paper-thin career mode, fictitious players, and mediocre court graphics.;
Motor City Online Review;7.6;Good; Motor City Online delivers on its potential, but it's most definitely not for casual online gamers or those whose patience is easily taxed.;
Star Wars Galactic Battlegrounds Review;8.2;Great; On one hand, it's a derivative real-time strategy game. But on the other, it's a tidy little bundle of escapism that's perfect for a generation of gamers raised on Star ...;
Gradius Galaxies Review;7.8;Good; It's Gradius done good--if you're into that sort of thing.;
Dragon Warrior VII Review;7.7;Good; If you know you're in the market for a very lengthy and ultimately satisfying RPG and know you can get over the visuals, you owe it to yourself to give ...;
Kohan: Ahriman's Gift Review;7.7;Good; If you've never taken up arms in the Kohan universe, this is your second chance to introduce yourself to a new brand of real-time strategy game--and you shouldn't miss it ...;
Syphon Filter 3 Review;6.5;Fair; Syphon Filter 3 looks, plays, and feels more like an expansion pack for the previous games than a true sequel.;
The Sims: Hot Date Review;8.8;Great; Hot Date's real additions are its expanded social options and its new downtown area, both of which make an already-interesting game even more fun to play.;
NBA Live 2002 Review;7.7;Good; NBA Live 2002 seems to be falling behind competing hoops products on the market and didn't improve much in moving to the Xbox.;
Stunt GP Review;5;Mediocre; Aside from its amusing track design and decent customization elements, there really isn't anything much there in regard to actual compelling gameplay.;
All-Star Baseball 2002 Review;6.5;Fair; The GameCube version of All-Star Baseball 2002 exhibits many of the traits inherent to a port and ultimately fails to impress.;
Crazy Taxi Review;4.9;Poor; Sega's Dreamcast legacy deserves better.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Dark Summit Review;7.1;Good; Ultimately, this trek into uncharted territory produces a fun experience that will constantly keep you trying to complete challenges.;
Deadly Dozen Review;7.1;Good; Deadly Dozen is Infogrames' entry into the previously nonexistent world of budget-priced tactical shooters. And true to the genre's recent run of luck, it's pretty darn good.;
Conflict Zone Review;4.4;Poor; Conflict Zone isn't a completely terrible real-time strategy game, but there's nothing about it that will scream for you to play it.;
NASCAR Heat 2002 Review;7.6;Good; NASCAR Heat 2002 chooses to err on the side of simulation racing and, for the most part, comes off as a highly realistic replica of stock-car racing.;
Asheron's Call: Dark Majesty Review;8.1;Great; If you're looking for classic online RPG hack-and-slash gameplay, Dark Majesty has more than enough to keep you busy for quite some time--and at a price that's more than reasonable.;
Cel Damage Review;5.7;Mediocre; Cel Damage simply fails to measure up.;
From Dusk Till Dawn Review;5.7;Mediocre; Though it features some really interesting new ideas for the horror game genre, its technical problems and overall lack of polish outweigh its few strengths.;
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 Review;9;Superb; The GameCube version may be less jaggy than the original PS2 release, but its lack of online multiplayer and somewhat sketchy frame rate keep it from living up to its ...;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
FIFA 2002 Review;9.3;Superb; Fans of real-life soccer will find this the most enjoyable soccer experience on the PC to date.;
James Bond in Agent Under Fire Review;6.8;Fair; Agent Under Fire isn't a horrible game, but its lackluster level design, poor enemy AI, and easy level of difficulty pile up to detract from what it does offer greatly.;
NASCAR Thunder 2002 Review;8;Great; Although the gameplay in NASCAR Thunder 2002 isn't quite as realistic as that of competing products, it is still a lot of fun.;
Supercar Street Challenge Review;3.9;Bad; For all its promise, Supercar Street Challenge will only leave you racing to find a better game.;
Half-Life Review;8.8;Great; Half-Life for the PS2 is a gripping combination of superb story design, sly artificial intelligence, taut combat sequences, and logical puzzles.;
4x4 EVO 2 Review;4.8;Poor; All of 4x4 EVO 2's small problems pile up to make playing the game as much fun as blowing a shock in a knee-deep mud bog.;
Splashdown Review;7.6;Good; Splashdown is a good racing game that--with a few tweaks-- could have easily been one of the greatest.;
Shaun Palmer's Pro Snowboarder Review;7.7;Good; While not without its flaws, the game capably brings the gameplay mechanics and general style of the Tony Hawk games to the mountain.;
Silent Hunter II Review;6.1;Fair; Each mission is tightly scripted and offers almost zero chance for freedom or exploration, which means there's very little replay value.;
Shrek Review;5.3;Mediocre; Only the youngest of players will find its gameplay compelling in the least, and even they, by now, have become accustomed to something more.;
18 Wheeler: American Pro Trucker Review;6.3;Fair; 18 Wheeler American Pro Trucker on the PlayStation 2 looks a bit more polished than the Dreamcast version, but much like that game, it is too short to hold your ...;
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x Review;7.7;Good; Anyone who is looking for a nice, solid freestyle sports game for the Xbox and who isn't looking for a graphical showpiece for his or her new system won't be ...;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Capcom vs. SNK 2: Mark of the Millennium Review;8.1;Great; The PlayStation 2 doesn't have a lot of good 2D fighting games available for it yet, so Capcom vs. SNK 2 can be easily recommended by default.;
WWF SmackDown! Just Bring It Review;8.1;Great; WWF SmackDown! Just Bring It improves upon the series' strong background with a more fleshed out story mode and more of the over-the-top WWF style.;
AirForce Delta Storm Review;6.8;Fair; AirForce Delta Storm's strength is clearly in its visuals.;
Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX 2 Review;7.4;Good; Questionable physics and a sloppy trick system still hinder the game from reaching its true potential.;
Soldier of Fortune Gold Review;7.3;Good;" Soldier of Fortune promises ""action movie"" gameplay and delivers.";
Tom Clancy's Rogue Spear: Black Thorn Review;6.9;Fair; It's a solid but unremarkable addition to the aging tactical shooter.;
Battle Realms Review;8.7;Great; Battle Realms has style in spades--everything about it is slick, and it's noteworthy for that reason alone, as well as for many others.;
Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty Review;9.6;Superb; It boils down to this: You need to play Metal Gear Solid 2.;
Madden NFL 2002 Review;8.6;Great; If you enjoy simulation-style football games that play well, have incredible depth, and look great, Madden 2002 is your game.;
Empire Earth Review;7.9;Good; Regardless of whether you've played other games like it, you'll find that Empire Earth is massive--more than most real-time strategy games would dare to be.;
Madden NFL 2002 Review;8.6;Great; If you're a PS2 owner wondering if you should get the Xbox version of Madden 2002 because it might look better, the answer is no.;
Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Review;7.3;Good; Ghost Recon offers some excitingly tense moments, but problems often rear their ugly heads just when the game gets interesting.;
Project Gotham Racing Review;8.1;Great; Anyone who considers themselves a car fan should seriously consider adding Project Gotham Racing to their library of Xbox games.;
NFL Fever 2002 Review;7.9;Good; The casual football fan who wants a great-looking and solid-playing football game may not notice some of the AI quirks and high passing percentages in NFL Fever 2002.;
Myth III: The Wolf Age Review;8.4;Great; Even if the multiplayer isn't polished to match the expectations of a demanding online community, Myth III stands on its own as a great single-player game.;
Fuzion Frenzy Review;6.7;Fair; There are other, more-engaging multiplayer experiences to be had with the Xbox, but at this point, none have the pick-up-and-play appeal of Fuzion Frenzy.;
Halo Review;9.7;Superb; Not only is this easily the best of the Xbox launch games, but it's easily one of the best shooters ever, on any platform.;
Vampire Night Review;8.1;Great; What Vampire Night lacks in innovation, it makes up for with top-of-the-line production value, a challenging level of difficulty, and above and beyond some of the campiest voice acting ever.;
NHL Hitz 2002 Review;7;Good; Anyone who's played Midway's Wayne Gretzky games will be right at home playing NHL Hitz 2002 but will find it to be little more than a nostalgic walk down memory ...;
Golden Sun Review;8.6;Great; Golden Sun is a throwback to some of the SNES' best.;
Star Wars Rogue Leader: Rogue Squadron II Review;9.4;Superb; Rogue Leader: Rogue Squadron II improves upon its predecessor and serves up one of the best showcases for Nintendo's new system and an equally impressive game.;
Dead or Alive 3 Review;7.9;Good; Once you get past its graphics--and you will--you'll find that Dead or Alive 3 doesn't offer much of anything that hasn't been done in other 3D fighting games.;
Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee Review;7.9;Good; Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee is a very smart game with great puzzles, yet there's not enough variety in those puzzles to keep it completely entertaining throughout.;
SSX Tricky Review;9.4;Superb; More than just an upgrade of the original, SSX Tricky is the best snowboarding game ever made.;
Doom Review;7.9;Good; Despite a few minor alterations from the PC version, this handheld port contains the same gory gameplay that helped its ancestor launch a genre.;
Ms. Pac-Man: Quest for the Golden Maze Review;3.7;Bad; It's a monotonous gaming experience that's difficult to recommend even to those looking for a little nostalgia.;
Wave Race: Blue Storm Review;8.5;Great; While not perfect, Wave Race: Blue Storm is the most accurate video game representation of water-based racing ever to be released.;
Luigi's Mansion Review;7.9;Good; Luigi's Mansion features some refreshing ideas but fails to match the classic status of Mario's adventures.;
Dark Summit Review;7.8;Good; There's nothing that really makes Dark Summit particularly impressive, but it's a good game that's certainly worthy of a rental.;
Super Monkey Ball Review;8.8;Great; The game makes a strong case for the power of simple yet incredibly addictive gameplay.;
Stronghold Review;7.6;Good; Stronghold simulates castle sieges well enough to recommend it to those who are interested in the premise.;
Mystery of the Druids Review;4.6;Poor; The setup promises both sleuthing and suspense, but Mystery of the Druids delivers neither.;
Flight Simulator 2002 Review;9.3;Superb; Whether you're a nervous tenderfoot or hardened devotee of desktop flying, this is the Flight Simulator you've been waiting for.;
World War III: Black Gold Review;8.4;Great; It's an all-around great real-time strategy game that also happens to stand out from other games in the genre.;
MXRider Review;7.2;Good; MXRider offers a good amount of playability for anyone even remotely interested in motocross or racing games in general.;
Smuggler's Run 2: Hostile Territory Review;8.3;Great; Smuggler's Run 2: Hostile Territory will instantly endear itself to fans of the original, as it is essentially a better-looking and more fun version of the original.;
Fatal Fury: Mark of the Wolves Review;8.5;Great; It's a port of one of SNK's last great NeoGeo games. It's also one of the last great games for the Dreamcast.;
Lady Sia Review;8.7;Great; Thanks to its solid control, clever puzzles, and stellar production values, Lady Sia is easily worth a trip to the local game shop.;
MechWarrior 4: Black Knight Review;7.6;Good; Players itching for more mech combat might as well get Black Knight, if not because it's a good add-on to a great game, then because there's no alternative.;
Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex Review;6.6;Fair; For better or worse, The Wrath of Cortex is no different from previous Crash Bandicoot games.;
Burnout Review;8;Great; Burnout is one of the most intense and entertaining racing games on the PlayStation 2, complete with tight controls and impressive graphics.;
Aliens Versus Predator 2 Review;8.7;Great; It's better than the original Aliens vs. Predator, and it's one of the best action games released so far this year.;
4X4 EVO 2 Review;7.8;Good; If you can put up with some frustrating inconsistencies and technical problems, 4x4 EVO 2 offers some thrilling off-road racing.;
NBA Live 2002 Review;7.7;Good; NBA Live 2002 does not improve significantly on last year's version and seems to be falling behind competing hoops products.;
Super Street Fighter II: Turbo Revival Review;9;Superb; Unquestionably, Turbo Revival is a perfect choice for any Game Boy Advance owner looking for some great fighting action on the go.;
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 Review;9;Superb; If you're not ready to commit to the PlayStation 2 yet, and you've grown weary of the levels in Tony Hawk 2, then Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 is just ...;
Top Gun: Combat Zones Review;6.2;Fair; Top Gun: Combat Zones lacks the value and longevity of better games in its field.;
Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX Review;7.8;Good; It's been said that if it ain't broke, don't fix it, and Activision took the adage to heart when creating Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX.;
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 Review;10;Essential; Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 strikes a perfect balance between new and old and renders the two previous entries in the series almost completely obsolete in the process.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Magic & Mayhem: The Art of Magic Review;6.5;Fair; The Art of Magic is an interesting game whose every strength seems to be hurt by a related weakness.;
Civilization III Review;9.2;Superb; Civilization III is a triumphant proclamation that strategy gaming is alive and well and still able to keep you rooted in front of your computer for hours at a time.;
Soul Reaver 2 Review;8.8;Great; Soul Reaver 2, as the saying goes, burns bright, but not as long as you'd like.;
Williams Pinball Classics Review;7.7;Good; This budget-priced collection may not be as accurate as the Pro Pinball series, but the physics are good and so are the tables themselves.;
Jekyll & Hyde Review;3;Bad; It's so crippled by confusing camera angles and bad control that it seems less like a game and more like a parody of the action-adventure genre.;
Ballistics Review;6.3;Fair; If unadulterated speed and kaleidoscopic imagery sounds like fun, Ballistics is your ticket to paradise. But many racing fans may well find that paradise short-lived.;
NBA 2K2 Review;9.7;Superb; The improvements in the game, although subtle on the surface, are substantial for serious fans of the NBA.;
Project Eden Review;7.8;Good; The logical environment-based puzzles in Project Eden represent what may be the best hope for the continuing evolution of adventure games.;
Bomberman Online Review;6.9;Fair; Bomberman Online takes an old standard and makes it feel at least somewhat fresh again.;
Zoo Tycoon Review;7.1;Good; Zoo Tycoon is a mostly enjoyable strategy game that's suitable for all ages, and it's a game that parents can play with their children.;
Madden NFL 2002 Review;9.1;Superb; Fans will find more than enough reason to get the latest and best version of Madden football we've seen on the N64 yet.;
Sega Sports Tennis 2K2 Review;8.5;Great; Tennis 2K2 honors the look and feel of the original Virtua Tennis, but the innovations made may not be enough to warrant a purchase for those veteran Virtua Tennis players ...;
Supercar Street Challenge Review;5.8;Mediocre; Supercar Street Challenge demands an extraordinary suspension of belief to enjoy, even on the most rudimentary levels.;
Ace Combat 04: Shattered Skies Review;8.8;Great; Ace Combat 04: Shattered Skies is a highly enjoyable, well-executed flight sim that perfectly blends the action elements found in the series' earlier games with the sort of narrative typically ...;

F1 2001 Review;8;Great; While the game improves upon a few aspects of F1 2000 and F1 Championship Season 2000, its handful of changes might not be enough to recommend it.;
Thunderstrike: Operation Phoenix Review;7.8;Good; Players looking for a detailed flight simulation will enjoy Thunderstrike's tactical gameplay, but fans of visceral action will find its strike-and-hide gameplay requirements a bit too rigid.;
The Weakest Link Review;4.4;Poor; Only those who like collecting anything to do with a show that probably won't last more than a season or two in the States should seriously consider The Weakest Link.;
Patrician II Review;7.7;Good; Patrician II successfully blends trading, city-building, and simple ship combat in a way that's constantly engaging.;
Kinetica Review;7;Good; The interesting character design and unique stunt system set it apart from the pack, but the fluctuating frame rate, track design issues, and poor sensation of speed hold it back ...;
WWII Iwo Jima Review;4.3;Poor; Ultimately, WWII Iwo Jima is a short game that is almost an insult to one of the greatest military campaigns forged by the United States.;
BASS Strike Review;5.1;Mediocre; The frustrating controls ruin what would have been a perfectly good fishing game.;Video Producer/Shooter/Editor. Mass Consumer of Television &amp
Jumpgate Review;8.6;Great; Jumpgate is a deep, well-designed game that incorporates the best elements of space-combat simulations and role-playing games.;
Zoboomafoo: Leapin' Lemurs Review;3.8;Bad; If Zoboomafoo is successful at doing one thing, it's working as an advertisement for the children's TV show on PBS.;
Spider-Man 2 Enter: Electro Review;7.1;Good; Die-hard webheads will no doubt complete the game several times to unlock all the hidden costumes and comic book cover galleries.;
NASCAR Thunder 2002 Review;8.2;Great; If you can see past its crunchy visuals, NASCAR Thunder 2002 is absolutely the best NASCAR title available for the PlayStation 2.;
Devil May Cry Review;9.1;Superb; Devil May Cry has successfully captured the twitch-based, relentlessly free-flowing gameplay style of so many classic 2D action games.;
Real War Review;3.7;Bad; Real War is a throwback to the days of those horrible real-time strategy clones that followed the success of Westwood's Command & Conquer series.;
The Mummy Returns Review;6.3;Fair; The Mummy Returns is a valiant attempt to make an interesting game playable for a wide audience, and it is, for the most part, successful.;Video Producer/Shooter/Editor. Mass Consumer of Television &amp
Ultimate Ride Review;7.5;Good; Ultimate Ride has a great basic premise that is sure to appeal to roller coaster fans of all ages.;
Paris-Dakar Rally Review;2.9;Terrible; Regardless of how passionate you are about rally racing, or just the ASO-sponsored event itself, it's doubtful that you'll tolerate Acclaim's mockery of the sport.;
Castlevania Chronicles Review;6.1;Fair; If your first encounter with Castlevania was Symphony of the Night or even some of the Super Nintendo games, you'll be disappointed by the dated graphics, static gameplay, and lack ...;
Batman: Vengeance Review;7.4;Good; Batman: Vengeance may not be one of the year's best overall, but it is one of those incredibly rare birds known as a good licensed game.;
Jack Orlando: A Cinematic Adventure Review;6.8;Fair; The puzzles and graphics are enough to recommend Jack Orlando to serious adventure game fans.;
Klonoa: Empire of Dreams Review;8;Great; It is a highly respectable emulation of the general feel of the Klonoa universe.;
F1 2001 Review;8;Great; Very few have managed to walk the fine line between appealing to the masses and appealing to those who require the utmost level of realism, but that's precisely what Electronic ...;

NBA ShootOut 2002 Review;6.1;Fair; NBA ShootOut 2002 is virtually identical to last year's game.;
Spider-Man: Mysterio's Menace Review;8.5;Great; Spider-Man: Mysterio's Menace is seven full levels of original gameplay steeped in old-school trickery.;
Final Fight One Review;8.4;Great; Final Fight represents straightforward arcade brawling at its absolute best. That the entire arcade game now fits in your pocket is quite frankly insane.;
Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare Review;6.9;Fair; The budget price of this game is sure to please just about any gamer willing to take the plunge into this well-saturated genre.;Video Producer/Shooter/Editor. Mass Consumer of Television &amp
The Typing of the Dead Review;7.5;Good; The Typing of the Dead certainly looks dated, but it's also surprisingly fun.;
High Heat Baseball 2002 Review;6;Fair; It's a decent freshman effort, but a lack of gameplay details and multiplayer features and substandard visuals limit the game's appeal to die-hard MLB fans only.;
Arctic Thunder Review;3.6;Bad; The gameplay is repetitive, and the game is easily one of the worst-looking PlayStation 2 games we've seen to date.;
Planet of the Apes Review;3.1;Bad; It fails at each of the three elements that can make this type of game enjoyable: exploration, combat, and puzzle-solving.;
Rails Across America Review;7.6;Good; It's a game whose real strengths are always in competition with its flaws. Happily for fans of hard-core strategy games, the strengths usually win out.;
Sub Command Review;8.4;Great; It is a sophisticated simulation for people who like their sims sophisticated.;
Capcom vs. SNK 2 Import Review;7.9;Good; IMPORT: It's cut from the same cloth as countless other Capcom fighting games, but it's got more features, more characters, and more depth than a lot of them.;
Command & Conquer Yuri's Revenge Review;8.5;Great; All its new features combine to make Yuri's Revenge ideal or even downright necessary for anyone who enjoyed Red Alert 2.;
F-14 Tomcat Review;7.2;Good; F-14 Tomcat's somewhat generic nature, dark visuals, and repetitious missions may deter the casual flight jockey.;
Time Crisis II Review;7.2;Good; Time Crisis II is a whole lot more fun than a console port of a three-year-old arcade game should be.;
Kessen II Review;7.7;Good; With its intuitive interface, pared-down strategy elements, and complex cinematics and storyline, Kessen II is designed to appeal to a more mainstream audience than any of Koei's previous strategy games.;
Throne of Darkness Review;7.1;Good; The influence of Diablo on Throne of Darkness is clearly evident--but while Throne of Darkness may be similar, you'll find that the Japanese setting isn't its only distinguishing feature.;
Formula One 2001 Review;7.2;Good; It's not the most visually astounding game, but it finds middle ground between being a rigid sim and a strap-in-and-stomp-it arcade racer.;
The Incredible Machine: Even More Contraptions Review;7.6;Good; Like its predecessor, Even More Contraptions is an excellent puzzle game that is sure to please amateur inventors and puzzle game fans alike.;
Sheep Raider Review;5.7;Mediocre; Looney Tunes: Sheep Raider is probably best left for those who will truly enjoy it: children.;
Pool of Radiance: Ruins of Myth Drannor Review;6.3;Fair; The game is primarily an uninspired dungeon crawl, burdened by repetitive gameplay, a cumbersome interface, and some serious technical issues.;
Zax: The Alien Hunter Review;7.5;Good; Zax succeeds admirably with its simple aims. It handles one vital game design element extremely well: pacing.;
NHRA Drag Racing Main Event Review;7.6;Good; NHRA Drag Racing Main Event crams an incredible amount of drag racing action into a budget game.;
NFL Blitz 2002 Review;2.6;Terrible; NFL Blitz 2002 for the Game Boy Advance isn't just a mere distortion of football, but a botched imitation of NFL Blitz itself.;
Trade Empires Review;6.8;Fair; Trade Empires lays out a broad and varied economic world that's initially interesting to explore, but over time, this doesn't justify all the effort the game demands.;
Commandos 2: Men of Courage Review;8.8;Great; It can be a difficult game, especially at first, but Commandos 2 truly evokes the intensity of World War II that you've probably seen in film or on television.;
F/A-18 Precision Strike Fighter Review;4.5;Poor; F/A-18 Precision Strike Fighter is a good flight sim for its time. The problem is that its time is four years past.;
Okage: Shadow King Review;7.8;Good; Even with its flaws, Okage remains a breath of fresh air for a genre in desperate need of the kind of originality and variety that it provides.;
Yanya Caballista: City Skater Review;4.6;Poor; Those intrigued by the game's bizarre premise or cel-shaded presentation will likely be disappointed by the shallow gameplay and repetitive mission objectives.;
NHL Hitz 2002 Review;6.7;Fair; Hockey fans might want to pick up NHL Hitz 2002 if they're looking for something different, but for everyone else, a weekend rental should suffice.;
Clusterball Review;6.7;Fair; While it may not be the world champion of team-oriented multiplayer games, Clusterball is an unusual and enjoyable addition to the genre.;
Phantasy Star Online Version 2 Review;8;Great; With its better balance, new features, and addictive gameplay, PSO Version 2 stands out as one of the last great games for the system.;
Monopoly Tycoon Review;8.5;Great; Monopoly Tycoon uses the popular board game as the base on which to build a strong and innovative, and great-looking, real-time game of business management and city building.;
Silent Hill 2 Review;7.7;Good; Silent Hill 2 is a much prettier, somewhat smarter but less-compelling game than the original.;
Spy Hunter Review;7.8;Good; It's a solid reinterpretation of a video game classic that adds its own unique elements to the franchise without forsaking what made Spy Hunter what it was.;
NHL 2002 Review;8.9;Great; NHL 2002 is the deepest, most realistic 3D NHL game on the market.;
Heavy Metal: Geomatrix Review;3.4;Bad; Heavy Metal is simply an uninteresting licensed 3D arena shooter that feels extremely rushed and won't impress anyone.;
Open Kart Review;6.2;Fair; Open Kart is an uneven proposition that is too fleeting for most and too simplistic for serious simulation buffs.;
Ico Review;8.5;Great; At a moment when cheap visual fluff is all too often framed by derivative game mechanics, ICO stands sound and elegant.;
NHL 2002 Review;9.2;Superb; There are quite a few excellent enhancements to the gameplay and the computer's artificial intelligence hidden beneath NHL 2002's dizzying array of flashy new features.;
Dance Dance Revolution Disney Mix Review;6.4;Fair; If you're a DDR fan who hasn't already imported the bevy of dancing games available in Japan, DDR Disney is worth checking out.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX Review;7.6;Good; Mat Hoffman is easily the best BMX game on the Dreamcast.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Spider-Man Review;6.6;Fair; Spider-Man will let you play hero for a day, but be ready to fight with the game's weaknesses as well as its villains.;
Monster Rancher 3 Review;8.4;Great; Offering a successful mix of old and new features, Monster Rancher 3 is a solid entry in the series.;
Silent Scope 2: Dark Silhouette Review;5.1;Mediocre; Considering how much of the game's appeal was based on the sniper rifle alone, removing it leaves behind a substandard game.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Road to India: Between Hell and Nirvana Review;7;Good; Road to India is a fine example of old-school adventure gaming with a modern presentation.;
Far Gate Review;6.3;Fair; In spite of the game's original qualities, there are just too many other, better choices available to make it worthwhile for most real-time strategy game players.;
Red Faction Review;7.9;Good; Red Faction is an accomplished shooter--it deserves a look from fans of the genre, as well as from those who've been impressed with Volition's other achievements.;
WWF With Authority! Review;7.2;Good; It's a solidly designed card game that suitably incorporates aspects of wrestling and individual wrestler trademarks in a no-frills, easy-to-learn setting.;

Tales of Destiny II Review;7.1;Good; If you value the gameplay that really makes an RPG what it is, you'll find a lot to like in Tales of Destiny II.;
Portal Runner Review;6.7;Fair; Your enjoyment of Portal Runner depends wholly on your tolerance for both straight-up, albeit slightly watered-down, 3D platform-adventure gameplay.;
ESPN X Games Skateboarding Review;6.7;Fair; Thanks to its dichotomous design, fans of the vert event will love X Games Skateboarding, while street fans should look elsewhere.;
Ooga Booga Review;7.2;Good; Ooga Booga is a lighthearted and somewhat original game, but it's not quite as addictive as the games it most closely resembles.;
Stretch Panic Review;7.1;Good; The game is wildly unorthodox in almost every conceivable respect, though its aesthetics and mechanics are awesomely polished and inventive.;
Tang Tang Review;4.8;Poor; Although it is indeed short, easy, and unimpressive, Tang Tang may actually find a welcome audience with younger game players, as well as those who just love block-creation puzzle games.;
Shattered Galaxy Review;8;Great; The battles in Shattered Galaxy can be spectacular, tense, and exciting, with one caveat: you're always limited to one small corner of the action.;

Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX 2 Review;7;Good; Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX 2 does not suffer from any single huge, crippling flaw;
Dragonriders: Chronicles of Pern Review;4.9;Poor; It takes the primary elements of the Pern novels and uses them to fashion a run-of-the-mill adventure game that offers very little actual adventure and too many frustrating mechanical issues.;
Primal Prey Review;3.9;Bad; Primal Prey is a budget version of another budget-priced game, and it's exactly as undistinguished as that makes it sound.;
Sudden Strike Forever Review;5.8;Mediocre; Numerous tweaks make it a much-improved experience in both the solo and multiplayer modes, though not so much that your thoughts about the original should be reevaluated.;
Dragonriders: Chronicles of Pern Review;6.2;Fair; Dragonriders is hardly a terrible game, but it has its share of issues and won't appeal to a large group of gamers.;
Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis Review;8.7;Great; The setting is perfect shooter material, and Operation Flashpoint does justice to it with complex gameplay coupled with a huge and truly memorable gameworld.;
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 Review;9.5;Superb; Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 represents nothing less than the best skateboarding game the system has to offer.;
Lightweight Ninja Review;3.9;Bad; There's really nothing to Lightweight Ninja aside from running, jumping, picking up items, and occasionally shooting an enemy.;

Death Crimson OX Review;4.2;Poor; It's hard to recommend Death Crimson OX to anyone but the truly desperate light-gun fanatic.;
Dark Angel: Vampire Apocalypse Review;3.9;Bad; Why anyone would make an action RPG without the all-important RPG element is beyond comprehension.;
Armored Core 2: Another Age Review;8;Great; Armored Core 2: Another Age remains a solid, thoroughly playable mech-combat simulator, with enough tools and options to please any fan of the genre.;

The Nations Review;6.4;Fair; The Nations takes the familiar Settlers gameplay and manages to not screw it up in any meaningful way.;
Madden NFL 2002 Review;6.7;Fair; An extended period of time spent with Madden NFL 2002 will likely prove unfulfilling to all but the most forgiving arcade sports gamers.;

Shogun: Total War Warlord Edition Review;8.5;Great; For the game's existing fans, it's a must-have. And for the uninitiated, it's an ideal opportunity to see what all the fuss was about.;
The Settlers: Fourth Edition Review;6.4;Fair; The fact that the basic formula of The Settlers is fun makes it all the more frustrating that, four games later, little has been done to keep the formula fresh.;
MTV Total Request Live Trivia Review;4.1;Poor; MTV TRL Trivia is typically a bubblegummer's who's who that simply won't appeal to fans of general entertainment trivia.;
Green Berets Review;6.7;Fair; Enemy-packed level design contributes to a single-player experience that is significantly harder on the normal difficulty level than the notoriously challenging Myth and Myth II single-player campaigns.;
Resident Evil Code: Veronica X Review;9;Superb; Resident Evil Code: Veronica X is an excellent port of a game that was released a year and a half ago.;
Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura Review;7.3;Good; If you're serious about role-playing games, Arcanum is well worth the investment of time, money, and effort.;

Cultures Review;5.8;Mediocre; There's a lot of gameplay in Cultures, but it's mainly because the designers keep forcing you to do the same thing over and over.;
Jurassic Park III: The DNA Factor Review;3.6;Bad; This game has nothing to do whatsoever with Univeral's megahit movie. What it has to do with dinosaurs, or even video games in general, is also unclear.;
The Corporate Machine Review;8.4;Great; Winning design, powerful artificial intelligence, and a great sense of humor make The Corporate Machine one of the best strategy games so far this year.;
Vietnam 2: Special Assignment Review;3.4;Bad; Vietnam 2 is a generic shooter in the worst sense of the phrase.;
NFL GameDay 2002 Review;8.1;Great; GameDay 2002 does a decent job of delivering a fun and somewhat realistic game of football to the PlayStation.;
Eurofighter Typhoon Review;6.6;Fair; Having to jump around from plane to plane gives Eurofighter Typhoon a scattered feel in which you're fighting timing rather than flying missions.;
Mega Man Legends Review;3.6;Bad; Mega Man Legends is an unembellished port of a forgettable 3-year-old PlayStation game.;
Klonoa 2: Lunatea's Veil Review;8.9;Great; Because of its airtight gameplay, awesome visuals, and great soundtrack, Klonoa 2 is an almost perfect platform game--almost.;
Mobile Suit Gundam: Journey to Jaburo Review;6.8;Fair; Mobile Suit Gundam is enjoyable despite its flaws, and it offers those who have never seen the original television series or its movie adaptation a condensed version of a classic ...;

Empire of the Ants Review;5.6;Mediocre; Empire of the Ants just doesn't do justice to the really unusual and interesting premise.;
The Sting! Review;7;Good; Entertaining gameplay overcomes a strange presentation and awkward design in this lighthearted burglary simulator.;
Rune: Viking Warlord Review;4.9;Poor; Rune: Viking Warlord proves that a solid concept is nothing without strong execution and that exorbitant amounts of carnage will never mask a game's faults.;
Dragon Warrior III Review;7.6;Good; DWIII is a worthy port of its old NES ancestor, but its firm grounding in the RPG old-school means that only the hard-core need apply.;
Extermination Review;7.1;Good; It's far from being poor and is certainly entertaining at times--it just lacks the originality and extra level of polish needed to provide a truly memorable gaming experience.;
Outtrigger Review;7;Good; Iif you're a broadband-adapter owner looking for something new that supports your woefully neglected device, Outtrigger fits the bill nicely.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
WarJetz Review;6.6;Fair; Graphical issues notwithstanding, WarJetz is a fun two-player battle game with a decent single-player campaign.;
Anachronox Review;7.8;Good; Anachronox is a solid addition to the genre and makes up for some rough spots with a welcome sense of humor and a lot of personality.;
Billiards Review;3.7;Bad; The money spent on this game would be better spent playing a real game of pool.;
Rugby 2002 Review;6.8;Fair; Anyone with an interest in rugby will definitely get something out of this game.;
Pac-Man Collection Review;8;Great; Regardless of their age, the simple, undemanding diversions found in Pac-Man Collection are perfect for today's portable systems.;
MechCommander 2 Review;7.7;Good; Those looking for a visually impressive, enjoyable real-time strategy game set in the BattleTech universe should find that MechCommander 2 fits that description well.;
NCAA Football 2002 Review;8.6;Great; NCAA Football 2002 takes another step in creating its own identity, separate from the Madden series, and is able to stand on its own merits.;
Desperados: Wanted Dead or Alive Review;6.8;Fair; The vivid and inviting setting in Desperados can't make up for some substantial gameplay flaws.;
Front Office Football: The College Years Review;8.2;Great; The heart of The College Years lies in its superb depiction of player recruiting.;
Atari Anniversary Edition Review;6.3;Fair; Featuring 12 games total, Atari Anniversary Edition contains more games than your average retro collection.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Stupid Invaders Review;6.2;Fair; Despite its impressive graphics and excellent voice acting, the simplistic and monotonous nature of Stupid Invaders' gameplay manages to drag down an otherwise entertaining experience.;
Digimon Digital Card Battle Review;5.1;Mediocre; While Digimon Card Battle accurately duplicates the flow and gameplay of the tabletop game, its simplicity will turn off any but the youngest of players.;
Atari Anniversary Edition Review;4;Poor; The PC version of this package does a far better job of emulating these classic Atari hits.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
City Crisis Review;6.3;Fair; While the game isn't especially amazing to look at or play, City Crisis scores points for originality.;Video Producer/Shooter/Editor. Mass Consumer of Television &amp
Motocross Mania Review;2.1;Terrible; With so many better supercross games on the market, many of them older and available at similar bargain-basement price points, Motocross Mania has no place in the market.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Anarchy Online Review;7.6;Good; If it can conquer its technical problems, Anarchy Online will be the very best online role-playing game around.;
Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare Review;5.6;Mediocre; It's a clumsy port, but what's even more disappointing is that it's a clumsy port of only a middling console game.;
WarJetz Review;4.6;Poor; The game's forgiving physics and plentiful mode choices make it a good choice for casual weekend competition;
NASCAR Heat 2002 Review;7.8;Good; While it will appeal to fans of NASCAR racing, it will probably appeal more to the less hard-core racing fan and to those who can ignore the game's slim damage ...;
911 Fire Rescue Review;5.8;Mediocre; As well intentioned as it might be, the game feels limiting and repetitive and as such is suitable only as a fleeting diversion.;
Final Fantasy Chronicles Review;8.5;Great; Final Fantasy IV and Chrono Trigger represent some of the best that the Square of old had to offer.;
Legends of Might and Magic Review;5.7;Mediocre; Ultimately, it's more disappointing than exciting, and not just because it's transparently modeled after a much better game.;
The King of Fighters 2000 Review;7.8;Good; While it may not be the last great NeoGeo game, it's certainly one of the last pretty good ones.;
Starfleet Command: Orion Pirates Review;7.9;Good; Orion Pirates has an impressive amount of content for a stand-alone expansion, so it's great for new players.;
Gran Turismo 3: A-Spec Review;9.4;Superb; Its endless tuning options and many racing events will keep you engrossed in the game for many months, and it's accessible enough to be enjoyed by anyone who's the least ...;
Le Mans 24 Hours Review;8.2;Great; Le Mans 24 Hours is just as meaty an experience as its predecessors.;
Battle Hunter Review;5.7;Mediocre; Battle Hunter is an easy-to-learn, yet addictive, trek into dungeon-based treasure collecting and RPG-style character development.;
Zeus Official Expansion: Poseidon Review;8.5;Great; Poseidon is as enjoyable as Zeus and suggests that Impressions' city-building series will just keep getting better.;
MX 2002 Featuring Ricky Carmichael Review;7.6;Good; MX 2002 is good enough to attract those of you who aren't already onboard the motocross train without alienating fans of the real thing in the process.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Review;8.2;Great; Lord of Destruction has a lot of depth that's readily apparent, yet it takes a long time to really see how much is packed into this great expansion.;
Tomb Raider: Curse of the Sword Review;7.1;Good; If you found the previous pocket-sized Tomb Raider too sluggish or bland, this new one probably won't change your mind.;
Rules of the Game Review;5.6;Mediocre; You'll start seeing repeats of the same questions far too soon.;
Bomberman Tournament Review;8.6;Great; Bomberman Tournament is easily the best Bomberman to hit these shores since Saturn Bomberman in 1997.;
Top Gear GT Championship Review;5.9;Mediocre; Top Gear GT Championship barely suffices in the make-or-break categories of graphics, sound, and gameplay.;
Hot Potato! Review;7.7;Good; Although Hot Potato! is probably very different from the shooters or puzzle games that you're used to playing, it's also quite entertaining.;
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine: Dominion Wars Review;6;Fair; When it's working properly, Dominion Wars still just ends up feeling like a really slick series companion rather than like a full-blown strategy game.;
Capcom vs. SNK: Millennium Fight 2000 Pro Review;6.9;Fair; IMPORT - Though its gameplay isn't especially deep, Millennium Fight Pro is an enjoyable slugfest that'll let you play with teams of some of the most popular 2D fighting-game characters ...;
Hot Wired Review;4.3;Poor; It simply doesn't deliver nearly enough intrigue or complexity even for its budget-conscious $19.99 price point.;
Bloody Roar 3 Review;5.5;Mediocre; The game is visually keen, and its pacing is marvelous, but its fighting system is remarkably slim, emphasizing one-button combos and nearly instant-kill supers.;
Tweety & The Magic Gems Review;3.2;Bad; While the GBA needs a party game, Tweety & The Magic Gems is far too laborious and bland to captivate even the most carefree of audiences.;
Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal Review;8.7;Great; It's filled with high adventure, epic battles, and plenty of surprises, and it's got a good cast, a good story, and more of all the elements that have made the ...;

Fur Fighters: Viggo's Revenge Review;7.3;Good; Fur Fighters holds its own with a quirky, refreshing style.;Video Producer/Shooter/Editor. Mass Consumer of Television &amp
Ripley's Believe It or Not! Review;7;Good; The game's combination of off-the-wall facts and bizarre photos is a welcome addition to the party trivia genre.;

Who Wants to Be a Millionaire 3rd Edition Review;4.6;Poor; At this point in the series, the execution and the host are so familiar that the only appeal left is the trivia challenge itself, which is unfortunate.;
18 Wheeler American Pro Trucker Review;6.5;Fair; 18 Wheeler would be easier to recommend as a budget title;
Worms World Party Review;8.4;Great; Like the other Worms games, World Party appears simplistic at first, but it actually packs a level of deep strategic value that other games in the genre could only hope ...;

Escape from Monkey Island Review;8.1;Great; The game features plenty of great-looking scenery, memorable characters, and funny dialogue.;
X-Men: Wolverine's Rage Review;5.4;Mediocre; Discerning action aficionados require much more than the 13 brief levels of slashing, jumping, and supernatural healing that this game has to offer;
CART Fury Championship Racing Review;5.7;Mediocre; With the game's bad AI, out-of-place music, and long load times, CART Fury causes a lot of unnecessary frustration.;
Commander Keen Review;6.8;Fair; Commander Keen was always better suited to a platform where instant save games could make up for its frantic gameplay and cranked difficulty.;
Fire Pro Wrestling Review;8.7;Great; It shines as an enjoyable, solid wrestling game that will provide hours upon hours of entertainment to fans of the genre.;
Army Men Advance Review;4.4;Poor; Kids will likely enjoy its simplicity but will find it difficult to complete several of the game's goals due to the irritating hit detection and cramped areas.;

Steel Soldiers Review;6.8;Fair; Without exceptional gameplay or style, Steel Soldiers ends up as a fairly formulaic real-time strategy game.;
Train Simulator Review;8.2;Great; Train Simulator will be a joy for anyone with even a passing interest in trains.;
Rayman Advance Review;7.6;Good; It's a great platformer and one among many games in the Game Boy Advance launch lineup that's easy to recommend.;

Ready 2 Rumble Boxing Round 2 Review;7.6;Good; Ready 2 Rumble Boxing Round 2 for the Game Boy Advance is a surprisingly good interpretation of its console counterpart.;
Super Dodge Ball Review;7.1;Good; Super Dodge Ball does a good job of showcasing the power of the Game Boy Advance--it's fast, colorful, and fun to play.;

GT Advance Championship Racing Review;7.3;Good; It's really a shame that THQ opted to adopt a password feature instead of the battery-save option, because it has added a lot of hassle to what would otherwise be ...;
Bowling Review;2.3;Terrible; It comes as no surprise that the $10 you would spend on purchasing this game would be better spent on several games at a real bowling alley.;Video Producer/Shooter/Editor. Mass Consumer of Television &amp
Gangsters 2: Vendetta Review;5.4;Mediocre; If the business elements were deeper, or if there was some sort of strategic combat in the game, Gansters 2 could have been a much more interesting game.;
Iridion 3-D Review;5.6;Mediocre; From a gameplay standpoint, the game falls flat.;
Half-Life: Blue Shift Review;7;Good; The bad news is that Blue Shift, the actual game, doesn't amount to much on its own terms. The good news is that the revamped graphics and inclusion of Opposing ...;
Namco Museum Review;7.2;Good; The Game Boy Advance version of Namco Museum isn't the best translation that these arcade classics have ever seen, but the ability to take them with you wherever you go ...;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Castlevania: Circle of the Moon Review;9.6;Superb; Anyone craving an amazing 2D adventure--not just Symphony of the Night fans--would be absolutely foolish to pass on this one.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Atlantis: The Lost Empire Review;4.7;Poor; While the unusually small levels keep the pacing of the game fairly brisk, you'll also find that it takes about two hours of casual playing time to finish the entire ...;

Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 Review;9.3;Superb; The development team at Vicarious Visions has captured the essence of THPS2 and, outside of a few necessary changes, has delivered most of what made the console versions of Tony ...;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Boxing Review;5.9;Mediocre; Boxing is just simply a fun game to play that is more than worth its $10 price tag.;
F-Zero: Maximum Velocity Review;8.1;Great; While not revolutionary in any regard, F-Zero: Maximum Velocity is a challenging yet addictive racer with speed to spare.;
Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX: Maximum Remix Review;5.4;Mediocre; The graphics in Maximum Remix are roughly identical to the first game, so you're stuck with muddy, ugly textures and quite a bit of texture warping.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Power Spike Pro Beach Volleyball Review;6.2;Fair; While it lacks originality and has rather bland graphics, Power Spike is still an entertaining, budget-priced volleyball game.;
The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages Review;9.2;Superb; Ages is a wonderful game in its own right, and as a set with Seasons, it comes as highly recommended as a game can be.;
The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons Review;9.2;Superb; Although Capcom's Flagship team actually handled development on the two games, both of them pack in everything one expects from a good Zelda adventure.;
B-17 Gunner: Air War Over Germany Review;3.7;Bad; It's really just a shoot-'em-up game that gives you targets to shoot at but restricts your movement.;
Dark Cloud Review;8.1;Great; Dark Cloud successfully blends adventure, RPG, simulation, and strategy elements into one incredibly addictive game.;
World's Scariest Police Chases Review;3.6;Bad; The game's most obvious mistake is that the game lets people engage in only the pursuit part of the cops-and-robbers equation, leaving those with the deviant desire to outrun the ...;
Leadfoot Review;7.1;Good; Fans of arcade-style racing games should probably steer clear of Leadfoot, but dedicated racing fans will find in it a serious challenge and an opportunity to exhibit their finely honed ...;
Super Mario Advance Review;8.2;Great; Super Mario Advance effectively highlights the power of the handheld with its brilliant, rich visuals and will provide hours of challenging fun, especially for those who haven't played the original ...;
Pearl Harbor: Defend the Fleet Review;3.6;Bad; What should be an adrenaline-pumping, action-packed experience grows outright dull in a hurry.;
Confidential Mission Review;5.3;Mediocre; If Sega's previous arcade light-gun games still hold appeal for you, this game may be right up your alley.;
Off-Road Redneck Racing Review;7.2;Good; Overall, Off-Road Redneck Racing is a fun game, and its low price makes it especially attractive for fans of arcade-style racing.;
Cool Boarders 2001 Review;7.6;Good; For those who think SSX is too simplified and that ESPN X-Games Snowboarding is too difficult, Cool Boarders 2001 is a perfect compromise.;
Shrek: Fairy Tale Freakdown Review;4.9;Poor; The lack of moves, strategy, and a two-player mode limits the game's appeal.;
Red Faction Review;8.8;Great; Although Red Faction rarely outstrips the games it draws inspiration from, the fact that there are times when it shows them up at all is pretty impressive.;
Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX Review;7.8;Good; The soundtrack rivals Wipeout XL for the title of best licensed soundtrack ever.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Merchant Prince II Review;5.2;Mediocre; The core gameplay in Merchant Prince II holds up surprisingly well, despite the passage of almost six years, which in computer game terms is the equivalent of several geologic eras.;
Tokyo Xtreme Racer: Zero Review;7.6;Good; Although Tokyo Xtreme Racer: Zero is flawed visually, the gameplay system is both unique and entertaining.;
Gunlok Review;6.2;Fair; Some of the gameplay concepts are solid and even fairly entertaining, but since they never quite gel, Gunlok is ultimately less than the sum of its parts.;
Mario Party 3 Review;7.5;Good; Hudson's dedication to solid, addictive puzzle gaming that makes for a wholly enjoyable multiplayer experience is apparent.;
Crazy Taxi 2 Review;8.6;Great; While it would have been nice to see some slightly more drastic changes to the Crazy Taxi formula, fans of the original will immediately feel right at home with Crazy ...;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
MLB 2002 Review;8.5;Great; If you can get past the sluggish pacing and incessant overcomplication, MLB 2002 is a wonderful game.;
Myst III: Exile Review;8.7;Great; Myst III: Exile builds on the legacy of the series and provides an almost magical sense of wonder.;
Echelon Review;7;Good; In spite of its problems, Echelon does hit close enough to the mark to offer some fast and flashy, but ultimately shallow, thrills.;
Fly! II Review;6;Fair; It's very disappointing that a simulation with so much potential is marred by so many problems, because Fly II is fundamentally a good game.;
Project Justice Review;7.5;Good; Originally designed for the Naomi hardware in arcades, the Dreamcast version looks virtually identical to its coin-op counterpart.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Crazy Taxi Review;7.8;Good; Crazy Taxi is still a fun, exciting game, but fans of Crazy Taxi who already own the Dreamcast release don't really need to bother with the PlayStation 2 version.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Star Trek: Voyager Elite Force Expansion Pack Review;6.6;Fair; The Elite Force Expansion Pack ultimately lacks the focus of the original game.;
Gauntlet Dark Legacy Review;6.2;Fair; If you have a group of bored, bloodthirsty friends visiting, having Dark Legacy around would definitely be an asset.;
Robot Arena Review;3.9;Bad; The most disappointing problem with Robot Arena is the very poor artificial intelligence of the computer-controlled robots.;
Spec Ops: Ranger Elite Review;4.5;Poor; The squad premise of the game serves only to throw a few meaningless options into an otherwise thin game.;
Rune: Halls of Valhalla Review;5;Mediocre; It simply takes the weakest part of the original game and repackages it with a few ultimately inconsequential bonuses.;
Point Blank 3 Review;8.4;Great; Point Blank 3 follows in the footsteps of its predecessors by providing equal parts twitch light-gun action and fast-paced logic puzzles.;
KISS Pinball Review;1.3;Abysmal; KISS fans will be disappointed by the distinct lack of KISS, and pinball fans will be disappointed by the distinct lack of pinball.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
GigaWing 2 Review;7;Good; You'd be hard-pressed to find a more visually impressive shooter on the Dreamcast, and the game is highly playable to boot.;
Batman: Chaos in Gotham Review;7.4;Good; Batman: Chaos in Gotham does well by following a storyline that would have appeared in the comic book or animated series and dressed it up with an assortment of gaming ...;
Kuru Kuru Kururin Import Review;7.1;Good; IMPORT: Its premise is rather simple. You control a stick that spins at a constant speed, and you must maneuver this spinning stick through tightly designed mazes without touching the ...;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Kawasaki Fantasy Motocross Review;2.6;Terrible; Kawasaki Fantasy Motocross is a thoroughly flawed game from beginning to end and proves once again that big-name licenses mean nothing by themselves.;

Rumble Racing Review;8.5;Great; Rumble Racing looks good, moves fast, and is a blast to play, either by yourself or with a friend.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.

Evil Dead: Hail to the King Review;3.4;Bad; Evil Dead: Hail to the King unfortunately offers little of the appeal of its source material, as everything about the game is derivative, boring, or just plain bad.;
Roswell Conspiracies: Aliens Myths & Legends Review;6.2;Fair; As an action game, Roswell Conspiracies is rather basic, but the plot is certainly fanciful enough to appeal to less discerning consumers.;
Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine Review;6.9;Fair; If it weren't for all of the pointless wandering and the lack of plot development, Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine would have been a great game.;
Tropico Review;8.6;Great; The political wrapper that PopTop has built around the core of the game is sophisticated enough to appeal to all types of strategy game players.;
Super Bombad Racing Review;6.2;Fair; The game introduces a few clever concepts, but its length and the gameplay flaws significantly limit the game.;
Monkey Brains Review;5.9;Mediocre; It's suitable for those who like side scrollers but are looking for more puzzles and less action.;
ESPN National Hockey Night Review;3.8;Bad; National Hockey Night's graphics are solid, but its no-frills gameplay modes and abysmal control leech the fun from the game, leaving a superficial shell behind.;
Illbleed Review;6;Fair; The game puts even less of an emphasis on combat than Resident Evil-style games;
Spider-Man Review;7.2;Good; Fans of the long-running comic series and players in search of the ever-elusive novel game would do themselves a favor by checking out Spider-Man.;
Legend of the River King 2 Review;7.8;Good; Although the game itself isn't overwhelmingly deep in terms of either fishing strategy or RPG intricacy, the incorporation of a number of Pok&#233;
The $100000 Pyramid Review;6.4;Fair; Sierra's PC adaptation of The $100,000 Pyramid seeks to recapture the heyday of television game shows, yet only as a four-player party game is it successful.;
Evil Islands: Curse of the Lost Soul Review;7;Good; Hours will fly past as you progress from one exploit to another, hooked on the game's hack-and-slash formula.;
Majesty: The Northern Expansion Review;7;Good; The Northern Expansion costs about half the price of a new game, and significantly extends the longevity of the original.;
X-COM: Enforcer Review;6.4;Fair; On its own terms, Enforcer is a fast-paced and rather fun shooter, though it'll prove too easy for veteran players.;
Sega Smash Pack Volume 1 Review;4.5;Poor; Every single one of the ports is incredibly poor, resulting in nothing but disappointment for anyone looking to replay any of these classic games.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Dr. Mario 64 Review;7;Good; Dr. Mario is a legitimate and satisfying puzzle game that is executed rather nicely in this four-player-focused package.;
High Heat Major League Baseball 2002 Review;6.1;Fair; The true-to-life ball physics and accurate attributes of the players in the game translate into fairly accurate statistics and situations on the field.;
Outlive Review;5.2;Mediocre; While it may appeal to nostalgic Starcraft fans, there isn't anything in Outlive that isn't done much better in any number of recent games.;
Rogue Spear Review;6.4;Fair; Rogue Spear isn't a bad game, and it makes do with what it has going for it.;
Game Room Review;6.3;Fair; It's a decent value for players looking for computer versions of the real-life games.;
Tech Deck Skateboarding Review;7.5;Good; Tech Deck Skateboarding is a solid video game re-creation of the uniquely hands-on Tech Deck experience.;
The Simpsons Wrestling Review;6.4;Fair; In the end, wit and charm are the two most redeeming features of The Simpsons Wrestling, as it simply can't survive on its gameplay alone.;
Fate of the Dragon Review;7.4;Good; Unless the historical Chinese context interests you, you'll find that Fate of the Dragon is just another real-time strategy game with nothing really outstanding to recommend it.;
Cossacks: European Wars Review;7.1;Good; If you don't mind another variation on an oft-played theme, Cossacks has more than enough variety to ensure fun empire building and colorful clashes.;
MTV Sports: T.J. Lavin's Ultimate BMX Review;2.7;Terrible; Landing vert tricks and pulling off long grinds can be a chore, because the game has a seemingly random system of determining whether or not your bike is straight enough ...;
Waterloo: Napoleon's Last Battle Review;7.3;Good; Even though the game engine is definitely showing its age, hard-core strategy game players should still find a lot to like about Waterloo.;
Disney's Aladdin in Nasira's Revenge Review;6.3;Fair; There are flashes of Disney's magic in several aspects of Nasira's Revenge, but it isn't enough to overcome the game's technical shortcomings.;
WinBack: Covert Operations Review;7.2;Good; For those who are new to WinBack, it will be a nice, stealthy diversion until Metal Gear Solid 2 is released later this year.;
Army Men: Green Rogue Review;3.8;Bad; Green Rogue's cumbersome gameplay makes it a much more frustrating game than those that inspired it.;Video Producer/Shooter/Editor. Mass Consumer of Television &amp
Army Men: Air Attack 2 Review;6.7;Fair; Air Attack 2 is a major disappointment, not because it is an exceptionally bad game, but because it had the potential to be an exceptionally great game.;
Ultima Online: Third Dawn Review;6.9;Fair; Although the switch to a 3D engine may be seen as an attempt to attract new players, Third Dawn is nonetheless best suited for Ultima Online's current users.;
Summoner Review;7.6;Good; If you can tolerate its problems, you'll find that Summoner has an interesting combat system, an intriguing story, and an enjoyable multiplayer mode to boot.;
The Simpsons: Night of the Living Tree House of Horror Review;7.8;Good; THQ has managed to re-create a decade of Halloween specials into a single GBC game that's bound to give series fans hours of recreation.;
Tribes 2 Review;8.5;Great; Tribes 2 isn't easy to master, and it won't play well on every gaming PC, but when you're up and running it's a tremendous amount of fun.;
Smurf Racer Review;4.7;Poor; Younger gamers will enjoy racing against the computer or with a friend, while the more experienced will breeze through the game in no time flat.;Video Producer/Shooter/Editor. Mass Consumer of Television &amp
Mickey's Speedway USA Review;9;Superb; Varied gameplay, diverse options, gorgeous visuals, and ample two-player support make Mickey's Speedway USA a class-A title.;
Front Office Football 2001 Review;7.5;Good; It's easily the game of choice for football fanatics who want to micromanage every aspect of their favorite teams' operations.;
Kohan: Immortal Sovereigns Review;8.6;Great; Kohan's few shortcomings don't diminish the fact that it brings together a variety of proven concepts to offer a real-time strategy experience unlike any other.;
Aidyn Chronicles: The First Mage Review;5.9;Mediocre; The developers fared well in bringing some role-playing game conventions into the third dimension, but they weren't as successful with others.;
The Sims: House Party Review;8.3;Great; House Party's new features, which focus primarily on social interaction, enhance the basic game considerably, since they let you throw wild parties and make building houses even more enjoyable.;
Zone of the Enders Review;7.4;Good; While it has its moments, Zone of the Enders will ultimately be remembered more for its packed-in demo of Metal Gear Solid 2 than its own accomplishments as a video ...;
Quake III Revolution Review;7.7;Good; Quake III Revolution makes do with what it has to work with and manages to put on a pretty good show.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Black & White Review;9.3;Superb; No other PC game to date has so effectively combined so many seemingly incompatible elements into one highly polished game.;
Mars Matrix Review;6.9;Fair; It's really one of the more interesting shooters to see a home release in recent times, and there's really no telling when another will be released.;
Strikers 1945 Review;5.8;Mediocre; Psikyo's take on the classic conventions strike as true as most modern attempts, and the fans of such games should welcome the results.;
High Heat Major League Baseball 2002 Review;7.8;Good; As outstanding as the core elements of High Heat 2002 undoubtedly are, it's hard to emerge from an extended session of gameplay without some serious misgivings.;
Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble Review;8.3;Great; Yes, Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble is a gimmicky game, but it's a gimmicky game done well.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Record of Lodoss War Review;6.8;Fair; If you like Diablo, you'll like Lodoss. If not, steer clear.;

Serious Sam: The First Encounter Review;8.9;Great; It's a great looking, fun-filled game that has plenty of visceral thrills and absolutely, positively the biggest battles in any shooter to date.;
In Cold Blood Review;7;Good; It's good that the story of In Cold Blood is so interesting, because the game suffers from being a bit light on both action and adventure.;
MDK2 Armageddon Review;7.6;Good; PS2 owners who haven't played any other version of MDK2 should be pleased with the game, and Dreamcast owners who couldn't muster the dedication to complete the game might want ...;
Triple Play Baseball Review;8.3;Great; Triple Play Baseball is a solid baseball game that is suited for players who enjoy lots of deep drives, home runs, and fast-paced action.;
Adventure Pinball: Forgotten Island Review;6.6;Fair; While it has its faults, it is for the most part successful in adding first-person shooter flash to a traditional kind of game.;
Unison Review;5.2;Mediocre; The fatal flaw in Unison is the unforgivably shallow gameplay.;
Star Trek Away Team Review;5.5;Mediocre; It's a linear, repetitive, tedious game that ignores almost every lesson it should have learned from previous, more successful tactical combat games.;
Warriors of Might and Magic Review;3.6;Bad; You get the impression that there's a decent game hidden here somewhere;
Europa Universalis Review;8.1;Great; Once you get past the initial shock of how big and occasionally unwieldy the game is, you'll find that the detailed mechanics work to produce an unparalleled level of depth.;
SpongeBob SquarePants: Legend of the Lost Spatula Review;3.8;Bad; There is no evidence to suggest that children would actually enjoy playing a game this unremarkable--let alone adults.;
All Star Baseball 2002 Review;8.3;Great; This latest rendition sticks to the basic things that have made the series great, making it worthwhile even for those who aren't fans of the older games.;
Army Men: Sarge's Heroes 2 Review;5.5;Mediocre; Those who've found previous versions of the series to be underwhelming won't have their opinions changed by this latest installment.;
Tom and Jerry: Mouse Hunt Review;7.4;Good; Tom and Jerry: Mouse Hunt is a fun and exciting sportslike game that lives up the TV show's madcap, albeit sometimes violent, reputation.;
Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel Review;8.3;Great; It'll provide dozens of hours of entertainment to both fans of squad-based combat games and fans of the series and stands a good chance of turning one into the other.;
Daytona USA Review;8.6;Great; A greater variety of tracks, cars, and options makes this sequel seem fresh and new, while the addition of Internet play provides an assurance that you'll enjoy the game for ...;
Dance Dance Revolution Review;8.3;Great; Dance Dance Revolution is a great introduction to a truly unique series with incredibly addictive gameplay and a soundtrack that will have you humming for days.;
Toy Story Racer Review;6.8;Fair; The 3D visuals and cartoon-style charm contained within Toy Story Racer do make it an excellent choice for children, Disney fans, or Game Boy fanatics who enjoy visual gimmicks.;
Disney's The Little Mermaid II Pinball Frenzy Review;7;Good; Disney's The Little Mermaid II Pinball Frenzy is little more than a remake of Pok&#233;
The Moon Project Review;8.2;Great; Fans of the series will be able to dive right into the game and won't be disappointed.;
Unreal Tournament Review;9.4;Superb; Quake III Arena on the Dreamcast may offer more visceral gameplay, but Unreal Tournament is the most complete package yet.;
Star Wars: Battle for Naboo Review;6.4;Fair; Battle for Naboo delivers a fun, but ultimately short, gaming experience.;
Ring of Red Review;7.9;Good; It's a huge game that will easily consume a good deal of your time, and fortunately, its systems remain fresh throughout.;
Metal Slug X Review;8.2;Great; The Metal Slug games represent a high watermark for arcade side-scrolling shooter graphics, and the PlayStation port of X does not disappoint.;
ESPN NBA 2Night Review;7;Good; Although NBA 2Night shows potential as the first game in Konami's new basketball series, it doesn't excel in any specific category and thus finds itself a step behind EA's NBA ...;
KAO the Kangaroo Review;7.4;Good; Part of what makes Kao enjoyable is the mix of traditional platform game mechanics and the occasional extreme sports experience.;
Scooby-Doo! Classic Creep Capers Review;7.4;Good; The game is brief, but the tale it tells provides plenty of classic Scooby-Doo antics.;
Shadow of Destiny Review;8.2;Great; The original structure and narrative make Shadow of Destiny well worth playing, despite its minor flaws.;
4x4 Evolution Review;7.2;Good; Those looking for the Gran Turismo of off-road racing will find a lot to like in 4x4 Evolution, but casual racing game fans should look elsewhere.;
Dracula: The Last Sanctuary Review;5.5;Mediocre; Dracula: The Last Sanctuary has huge lapses in logic, no atmosphere, and very little in the way of respect for Bram Stoker's original story.;
Triple Play Baseball Review;8.5;Great; Triple Play Baseball is one of those rare games that really draws you into the experience with fantastic gameplay and quality graphics and sound.;
Colin McRae Rally 2.0 Review;8.5;Great; If you can work your way around its shortcomings, you'll find that Colin McRae Rally 2.0 is one of the most engrossing racing sims available.;
Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2001 Review;5.5;Mediocre; If golf isn't golf for you without those PGA masters and true-to-life courses, then Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2001 may meet your needs.;
High Heat Baseball 2002 Review;5.7;Mediocre; While the game isn't bad by any means, it just doesn't stand up to the other games on the market.;
Triple Play Baseball Review;5.1;Mediocre; The game turns the single most challenging action in sports into child's play.;
Project S-11 Review;6.3;Fair; Project S-11 is about the best the GBC is going to see in terms of space shooters.;
Surf Rocket Racers Review;4;Poor; Surf Rocket Racers is what happens when a game developer takes a stock game formula and simply goes nowhere with it.;
Blade of Darkness Review;7.2;Good; It's got some problems and takes some time to get into, but should otherwise appeal to players who've enjoyed previous hack-and-slash action games, or like the idea of them.;
The Bouncer Review;6.7;Fair; The Bouncer makes a great showpiece for the PlayStation 2.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Ford Racing Review;4.9;Poor; The poor AI and the limitations presented by the sole Ford license in particular keep it from being a truly entertaining game overall.;
Army Men World War: Final Front Review;6;Fair; Buried under the layers of poor visuals and rough control, there is indeed an engaging, playable game.;
Conker's Bad Fur Day Review;9.3;Superb; The premise of the game is gimmicky, but after its sordid skin is peeled away, a true gem of a 3D platformer is revealed.;
Monster Rancher Battle Card: Episode II Review;5.9;Mediocre; Battle Card Episode II re-creates a very playable, if visually unexciting, card game that those weaned on the cartoon and namesake breeding titles may find time to enjoy.;
Onimusha: Warlords Review;8.4;Great; While die-hard Resident Evil fans will be turned off by the game's length, others will find it to be the survival-horror game for people who don't like survival-horror games.;
NBA Hoopz Review;5.7;Mediocre; NBA Showtime fans may enjoy Hoopz, but the game would have benefited from an honest-to-goodness arcade mode and a speed setting, if not faster overall gameplay.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
1nsane Review;7.6;Good; 1nsane is the only 4x4 racing game to date that truly offers a sense of the freedom--and the chaos--found in real-life off-road racing.;
Vanishing Point Review;7.4;Good; Vanishing Point is one of the most original and enjoyable racing games to come around in a long time.;
Mission: Humanity Review;2;Terrible; There really is nothing good and nothing redeeming about Mission: Humanity.;
KAO The Kangaroo Review;7.1;Good; Despite a plethora of design and gameplay issues, it's hard not to enjoy the cute and varied experience contained within the game's 30 areas.;
Ducati World Racing Challenge Review;5.4;Mediocre; While the game boasts about 40 different Ducati motorcycles, Ducati World Racing Challenge is severely hampered by its flawed control, obsolete graphics, and bad sound.;
Crime Cities Review;5.9;Mediocre; After you play it for a while, you'll realize that all of its visual details don't amount to very much.;
America Review;4.8;Poor; There is actually very little in America that isn't taken straight from other, older, better real-time strategy games.;
Charge 'N Blast Review;5.9;Mediocre; Charge 'N Blast doesn't have any glaring flaws, but it also doesn't excel in any general category.;
Iron Aces Review;6;Fair; Iron Aces tries a little too hard to please the simulation and action crowd simultaneously.;
Pokemon Silver Review;8.8;Great; You really can't go wrong with 251 monsters, two main adventures, countless side quests, and a baseline of 60 hours of gameplay.;
NBA Hoopz Review;6.1;Fair; If it weren't for its abhorrent background music, tinny sound effects, and lack of a two-player feature, NBA Hoopz would be a glowing addition to the Game Boy Color's library.;
Dragon's Lair Review;7.5;Good; Eighteen years later, it's still a refreshingly innovative game.;
The Messenger Review;5.9;Mediocre; What's most disappointing about The Messenger is how it misses the opportunity to take advantage of a great premise.;
Clive Barker's Undying Review;9.1;Superb; Undying has superb graphics, truly impressive sound effects, and fast-paced, enjoyable action sequences. The entire game is very atmospheric, and a lot of fun to play.;

NBA Live 2001 Review;8;Great; The new edition of NBA Live doesn't really offer much in the way of new features--but it's still one of the best basketball games available.;
NBA Hoopz Review;6.3;Fair; While still fun in head-to-head situations, the few added features can't mask the fact that NBA Hoopz is basically the same exact game as last year's NBA Showtime.;
NBA Hoopz Review;6.9;Fair; NBA Hoopz for the Dreamcast is the same old song and dance that Midway has been perpetuating for years now.;
MAD - Global Thermonuclear Warfare Review;5.7;Mediocre; MAD is reminiscent of classic board games, because of its simple dynamics, and of classic arcade games, because of its hectic pace.;
Star Wars Starfighter Review;7.8;Good; The game presents a compelling story, excellent presentation, and gameplay that will surely satisfy fans of LucasArts' N64 shooters.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.

Dinosaur Review;4.8;Poor; What could have been a decent game is marred by lackluster execution.;

The Mummy Review;7.6;Good; Fans of spatially oriented puzzle games won't christen it the second coming of Solomon's Key, but there's enough challenge and intelligence within each of The Mummy's 46 stages to keep ...;
SimCoaster Review;6.8;Fair; SimCoaster dismisses the elegant design of its predecessor, and instead favors the often-overwhelming amount of management found in the original Theme Park.;

Thandor: The Invasion Review;4.7;Poor; The problem with Thandor: The Invasion is that its lack of creativity extends into every single part of the game.;
IHRA Drag Racing Review;5.3;Mediocre; Because of all the game's problems, it seems likely that not many players will stick with it long enough to enjoy it.;
The Outforce Review;7;Good; The Outforce won't wow real-time strategy players, but it's a solid space-based strategy game with good production values.;

Chicken Run Review;5.1;Mediocre; Chicken Run can be fun, if not particularly involving nor challenging, and kids should have a good time with it.;
Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX Review;6.6;Fair; Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX can be fun, but the occasional problems with the graphics and collision detection can quickly become a source of unnecessary frustration.;
Metropolis Street Racer Review;7.7;Good; Metropolis Street Racer is a beautiful racer with accurate physics and tight control, but the kudos system makes it far more challenging than it needs to be.;

Victorious Boxers Review;8.5;Great; Victorious Boxers is the most technically accurate interpretation of the sport of boxing ever made.;

Bang! Gunship Elite Review;6.9;Fair; Red Storm hasn't done anything wrong with Bang! Gunship Elite, but the elimination of the multiplayer features found in the PC version of the game limits its appeal.;
Xtreme Sports Review;7;Good; If you're in the mood for a game where each event is reasonably well designed and integrated into a greater, meatier whole, then Infogrames' Xtreme Sports should prove satisfying.;
Seven Games of the Soul Review;4.4;Poor; The real problem with Seven Games of the Soul is that it's not only nonsensical, but it's also pretentious.;
NBA Live 2001 Review;8.5;Great; By far, it's the best basketball game - pros or otherwise - on the PlayStation 2.;
Bugs & Taz: Time Busters Review;7.5;Good; Bugs & Taz: Time Busters does an excellent job of capturing the humor and personality that the Looney Tunes franchise embodies.;
Animorphs: Shattered Reality Review;3.5;Bad; If there's a silver lining to Animorphs: Shattered Reality, it's that it would make an excellent game for children who aren't yet old enough to tackle the meatier fare of ...;

Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine Review;6;Fair; Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine is a big game, to be sure, with enough levels to keep you busy over a three-day rental period.;
Sudden Strike Review;5.6;Mediocre; Sudden Strike is just like most any other 2D real-time strategy game, except without the depth introduced by building or resource management.;
Road Champs BXS Stunt Biking Review;6.9;Fair; Surprisingly, the game isn't just an attempt to cash in on a passing trend - it's also a decent addition to any stunt-bike aficionado's collection.;

El Dorado Gate Chapter 1 Import Review;6.7;Fair; IMPORT: Thanks the grassroots presentation, a relatively creative style of narrative, and an affordable price, El Dorado Gate Chapter 1 is a promising title.;
Sonic Shuffle Review;4.5;Poor; The combination of the unbearable load times, the smattering of minigames, and the poor minigame design make Sonic Shuffle a boring diversion at best.;
KISS: Psycho Circus Review;4.5;Poor; Instead of fixing any of Psycho Circus' problems, or adding some Dreamcast-only levels, the programmers at Tremor have actually removed some key features of the PC version.;

Tyco RC Assault with a Battery Review;6.7;Fair; Tyco RC stacks up well against the competition, but doesn't add any major innovations to the formula established by RC Revenge.;
Sanity: Aiken's Artifact Review;6.6;Fair; It features a generally successful mix of action and puzzle solving, but some of its poor design elements, the long loading times, and the tiresome multiplayer mode bring it down.;
Dino Crisis 2 Review;9.2;Superb; Dino Crisis 2 avoids the stereotypes of the genre and delivers one of the most refreshing takes on the third-person action shooter to date.;
Midtown Madness 2 Review;8.1;Great; If you want to play a very fun racing game, then Midtown Madness 2 is for you.;
Cool Cool Toon (Import) Review;7;Good; IMPORT: Cool Cool Toon is a sure bet for import-savvy rhythm game fans, who would be denying themselves some saccharine-drenched fun if they passed this one up.;

NFL Blitz 2001 Review;9;Superb; NFL Blitz 2001 for Dreamcast is a worthy update and a giant step above the PlayStation and Nintendo 64 versions of the same name.;
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 Review;9.9;Superb; As most major publishers' development efforts shift to any number of next-generation platforms, Tony Hawk 2 will likely stand as one of the last truly fantastic games to be released ...;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Gekikuukan Pro Baseball: The End of the Century 1999 Review;3.7;Bad; There's not one single element that stands out in Gekikuukan Pro Baseball: The End of the Century 1999, and the game is one big disappointment from start to finish.;
MTV Sports: Skateboarding Review;5.1;Mediocre; MTV Sports: Skateboarding is ultimately disappointing due to its average graphics, poor collision detection, and loose controls.;
The New Adventures of the Time Machine Review;3.8;Bad; It's a nonsensical story periodically interrupted by a string of infuriating puzzles.;
Radio Control Racers Deluxe: Traxxas Edition Review;7.1;Good; While the graphics and sound could have been better, the fast-paced gameplay and circuit options make the game interesting and enjoyable.;
Team Buddies Review;4.8;Poor; No amount of multimedia candy can save this game from its main flaw: boredom.;
Dino Crisis Review;7.1;Good; Dino Crisis fails to take advantage of the Dreamcast hardware, resulting in a game that is structurally sound but visually average by Dreamcast standards.;
Peter Jacobsen's Golden Tee Golf Review;2.3;Terrible; Golden Tee Golf doesn't contain anything that warrants a recommendation.;

Danger Girl Review;3.9;Bad; While not nearly as bad as, say, Titus' Superman for the N64, Danger Girl is not nearly as good as Activision's Spider-Man on the PlayStation.;
The Flintstones Bedrock Bowling Review;2.7;Terrible; In the grand tradition of licensed games, this one also falls far short of being interesting or fun to play.;
Madden NFL 2001 Review;9.1;Superb; Madden NFL 2001 for the N64 is the most complete and refined version of the game thus far.;
Capcom vs. SNK: Millenium Fight 2000 Review;8.2;Great; Issues of balance aside, Capcom has produced a great game.;

MTV Skateboarding Review;2.3;Terrible; MTV Skateboarding is a perfect example of cashing in on a recently established genre, yet unlike games like Street Sk8er 2 or Grind Session, it doesn't bring anything worthwhile to ...;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Star Trek: New Worlds Review;4;Poor; The derivative action in New Worlds does only one thing well: It reminds you how exciting a well-designed real-time strategy game can be by comparison.;
Who Wants to Beat Up a Millionaire Review;5.4;Mediocre; Who Wants to Beat Up a Millionaire is best reserved for those looking for a quick gag gift.;
NFL 2K1 Review;9.9;Superb; In the end, NFL 2K1 is a deeper, more refined version of the original game.;

Ore no Ryori Import Review;7.1;Good; IMPORT: A delightful little game recently inducted into Sony's PlayStation The Best series, Ore no Ryori is a quirk-fest that just about anyone can pick up and enjoy.;
Armored Core 2 Review;7.8;Good; Thanks to a few errant gameplay quirks, Armored Core 2 doesn't quite reach console mech perfection.;
Persona 2: Eternal Punishment Review;8.5;Great;" RPG fans looking for something other than the standard ""boy meets girl, boy loses girl in heart-wrenching cutscene, boy avenges girl's death and saves world"" formula should definitely give Persona ...";Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.

San Francisco Rush 2049 Review;8;Great; Seldom missing a beat when compared with its cabinet-bound counterpart, Rush 2049 is the ideal home port of an arcade game.;
High Impact Paintball Review;3;Bad; For a change, here's a bloodless first-person combat game. In addition to lacking blood, it also lacks replay value and fun.;

Maximum Pool Review;6.3;Fair; Maximum Pool's interface can prove to be very cumbersome, but if you can learn to tolerate how it plays, it's a great deal.;
Bomberman Party Edition Review;7.1;Good; Bomberman Party Edition manages to succeed where many previous attempts have failed, delivering an uproariously enjoyable multiplayer experience.;
Hogs of War Review;5.5;Mediocre; With four people joining in, the number of onscreen explosions, pig-speech comments, and all-around nuttiness nearly lifts the game into the same sphere of quality as Worms or Bomberman.;
Rayman 2 Review;8.2;Great; Rayman 2 is one of the best platforming experiences available on the PlayStation.;
NASCAR Heat Review;7.5;Good; NASCAR Heat offers a brutally honest driving experience, but with simplistic damage modeling.;
Gungriffon Blaze Review;7.6;Good; The plot is engaging, the action is fast, and the game itself offers one of the better takes on mech piloting the genre has seen in a long time.;
Madden NFL 2001 Review;7;Good; The flaws in the passing and running game prevent Madden 2001 from being completely enjoyable or realistic.;
Polaris SnoCross Review;5;Mediocre; For snowmobile fans with a little extra cash to burn, Polaris SnoCross proves to be a rather entertaining diversion as long as you can accept its odd collision glitches.;
Spider-Man Review;6.5;Fair; More fully realized than anything on the 8- or 16-bit systems, Spider-Man for the GBC is the game we all wish we had ten years ago - a totally convincing ...;
Turok 3: Shadows of Oblivion Review;7.9;Good; Shadow of Oblivion is successful because it concentrates upon what made the Turok franchise a best-seller instead of attempting to one-up the competition, making it in many ways the best ...;
Perfect Dark Review;5.3;Mediocre; Perfect Dark GBC does its Nintendo 64 counterpart justice, albeit haphazardly.;
Sega GT Review;7.3;Good; Sega GT attempts to capture some of Gran Turismo's formula for the Dreamcast, but it ultimately falls short due to poor control and an unintuitive interface.;

Mario Tennis Review;8.2;Great; Mario Tennis is a quality tennis presentation that strikes gold on the three points that matter most: value, gameplay, and fun.;
ATV: Quad Power Racing Review;4.8;Poor; There may be some ATV enthusiasts out there who will get enough out of ATV: Quad Power Racing to warrant a rental.;
Star Trek: Invasion Review;5.9;Mediocre; Despite the game's fluid control system and innovative lock-on features, its pacing and repetition simply mar the gameplay experience.;

Jeremy McGrath Supercross 2000 Review;4.5;Poor; Jeremy McGrath is an unfortunate example of what happens when sports games fall into a rut.;
Duck Dodgers Review;5.8;Mediocre; Duck Dodgers is a decent 3D platformer with a well-used Looney Tunes license.;
RC Revenge Review;7.3;Good; RC Revenge is intensely playable and highly polished - a far cry from its predecessor.;
Ultimate Fighting Championship Review;9.2;Superb; Overall, UFC successfully merges the ease of play you'd expect from a fighting game with the simulation aspects of a sports game.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.

Lego Rock Raiders Review;3.2;Bad; Somewhere in the transition from drawing board to television screen, something has gone awry.;
Surf Riders Review;6;Fair; In the end, Surf Riders is a fun game with decent gameplay, but the shortage of modes, run-of-the-mill graphics, and lack of variety prevent Surf Riders from being to surf ...;
Age of Empires II: The Conquerors Review;8.5;Great; It's a suitably excellent expansion to what remains one of the best real-time strategy games to date.;
Madden NFL 2001 Review;9.3;Superb; Madden NFL 2001 is arguably the most entertaining two-player sports game ever made.;
NFL GameDay 2001 Review;7.9;Good; In the end, GameDay 2001, aside from its obvious roster updates and a few minor additions, is totally identical to last year's title, which was a really good game.;
WWF Royal Rumble Review;6.5;Fair; If you're expecting SmackDown! with better graphics and more modes, you'll be disappointed by Royal Rumble's tightly focused gameplay.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Carmageddon 64 Review;2.1;Terrible; Carmageddon 64 has absolutely nothing going for it, which makes you wonder why it ever made it this far in the first place.;

Daikatana Review;3.7;Bad; Anyone looking for a Nintendo 64 shooter should do themselves a favor and look elsewhere.;
Ecco the Dolphin: Defender of the Future Review;8.2;Great; Ecco holds up the standards of creative execution that Sega has set for its flagship titles and simultaneously makes clearer the potential for artistry in video games.;
Mr. Driller Review;7.9;Good; If you're the type of person who can forgive a lack of features for an otherwise impeccable game, Mr. Driller might be a decent addition to your puzzle game library.;

NASCAR 2000 Review;7.6;Good; Offering 33 unique cars, 16 tracks, real-life drivers, a season mode, a variety of car-tuning options, and a two-player link-cable option, THQ has crammed a great deal into this pocket-sized ...;
Enemy Engaged Review;9;Superb; Enemy Engaged sets a higher standard for how immersive a flight sim can be, while it also avoids getting mired down in the technical minutiae of combat aviation.;
Heavy Metal: F.A.K.K. 2 Review;6.7;Fair; While it has some interesting sequences, and can be really enjoyable at times, more often F.A.K.K. 2 merely seems like the framework for a much better game.;
Metal Fatigue Review;6.9;Fair; Despite its problems, fans of anime or mech games should find that Metal Fatigue is a fun, fast-paced real-time strategy game.;
Action Bass Review;5.2;Mediocre; In the end, Action Bass is a solid arcade-style fishing game that the majority of armchair anglers will enjoy.;
Toonsylvania Review;4.6;Poor; With so many exceptional Game Boy platformers on the market, one simply can't justify picking up Toonsylvania.;
Aerowings 2: Air Strike Review;8.3;Great; Aerowings 2 boils down to excellent gameplay, copious replay, and creamy visuals, marred ever so slightly by chintzy music.;
NCAA Football 2001 Review;7.9;Good; Is NCAA 2001 different than last year's title, or the year before that? Nope, it's pretty much the same experience with a few new tricks.;

Xtreme Sports Review;8;Great; Xtreme Sports is definitely going to be an unsung hit.;
Sno-Cross Championship Racing Review;7.2;Good; Sno-Cross Championship Racing, a quality game based entirely on snowmobile racing, proves that there's no good reason for the unvaried focus of today's racing games.;

Dogs of War Review;5.4;Mediocre; Dogs of War seems not only unpolished, but also unfinished.;
Cleopatra Review;7.5;Good; Cleopatra adds more of just about everything, and makes Impressions' Pharaoh a more complex and interesting game, without disrupting the fine balance of the original.;
Army Men: Air Combat Review;7.5;Good; With the addition of four-player multiplayer, Army Men: Air Combat is the best game to bear the Army Men name.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Soulbringer Review;6.6;Fair; Soulbringer's lackluster graphics and poor interface compromise what's otherwise a fairly standard action/role-playing game with an interesting combat system.;

Walt Disney World Quest - Magical Racing Tour Review;7.5;Good; While it may be a Mario Kart clone, Magical Racing Tour does put forth a unique effort in two categories: graphics and sound.;
Indy Racing 2000 Review;7.1;Good; If you can overlook the muddy graphics, Indy Racing 2000 is surprisingly fun.;
Bang! Gunship Elite Review;6.4;Fair; You'll spend the majority of your time shooting throngs of enemy ships until you get so used to it you just want to stop playing.;
Fighter Destiny 2 Review;5.8;Mediocre; Fighter Destiny 2 is a sequel that rests solely on its predecessor's innovative gameplay mechanics and doesn't really offer anything new.;

BeachHead 2000 Review;3.9;Bad; BeachHead 2000's limited gameplay won't hold your attention for long.;
KISS: Psycho Circus Review;6.6;Fair; Once you've played the first ten minutes of Psycho Circus, you might as well have played the first ten hours.;
Final Fantasy IX Review;8.5;Great; Final Fantasy IX serves as a coda to the series as you know it - it's a summation of everything that players have enjoyed about the past ten years of ...;
Warlords Battlecry Review;8.4;Great; While Warlords Battlecry is evidently derivative of other fantasy-themed strategy games, its combination of elements taken from its predecessors makes the game unique in its own right.;

Beyond Atlantis Review;5.6;Mediocre; Beyond Atlantis is just a chain of nonsensical puzzles and conversations, albeit nonsense that attempts to be mystical.;
World Series Baseball 2K1 Review;4.9;Poor; One can't use high expectations to explain away all of WSB 2K1's flaws.;
Fur Fighters Review;7;Good; The multiplayer mode, called fluffmatch, is really where the game earns most of its points.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Armorines Review;2.9;Terrible; There are so many problems with Armorines on the PlayStation that to discuss them all would be like flogging a dead horse.;

Tokyo Xtreme Racer 2 Review;7.6;Good; Tokyo Xtreme Racer 2 is a decent game, but it's all been done before.;
Heroes of Might and Magic Review;4.6;Poor; Heroes of Might and Magic is an average strategy game that tries very hard to bring as many aspects of the genre as it can to the Game Boy Color.;Video Producer/Shooter/Editor. Mass Consumer of Television &amp

Rampage Through Time Review;4;Poor; Rampage Through Time has managed to warp and ruin any decent gameplay that may have been left in the original.;

PGA European Tour Review;4.3;Poor; Dated graphics, gameplay flaws, and meager extras all conspire to bring down an otherwise average golf game.;
Sakura Taisen Import Review;7.6;Good; IMPORT: While a little low on gameplay, Sakura Taisen's focus on story and presentation is handled expertly.;
Midway's Greatest Arcade Hits Volume 1 Review;5.5;Mediocre; If you're into classic arcade games, and you haven't already picked up this exact collection for the PlayStation or PC, this isn't a bad way to go.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Deus Ex Review;8.2;Great; Deus Ex's gameplay features and story elements, as well as the expansiveness of the game's environments and the scope of its setting, add up to a satisfying and unusual experience.;
Wacky Races Review;7.8;Good; With the exception of random AI, Wacky Races is a license-based racing game done right.;
Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure Review;5.9;Mediocre; If you're the type of RPGer who commits to checking out the most nonstandard manifestations of the genre, then Rhapsody is definitely worth your attention.;
Iron Soldier 3 Review;4.3;Poor; If your dream is to beat up walls with gigantic, iron fists while spraying military vehicles with fake-looking gunfire, then perhaps Iron Soldier 3 will be right up your alley.;
Ultima Online: Renaissance Review;7.1;Good; Ultima Online has finally reached the state it really should have been in when it was first released nearly three years ago.;
Asterix: The Search for Dogmatix Import Review;7.2;Good; IMPORT: Asterix: The Search for Dogmatix is one of the better combinations of platformer and plot to come out in recent years.;
Looney Tunes Collector: Alert! Review;6.5;Fair; Infogrames' Looney Tunes Collector: Alert! may not be Pok&#233;
All-Star Baseball 2001 Review;7;Good; Due to limitations in graphical and sound capabilities, handheld baseball titles still have a long way to go before they catch up to their console counterparts. Acclaim's All-Star Baseball 2001 ...;
BreakNeck Review;6.7;Fair; BreakNeck's impressive selection of cars and tracks add value to what would otherwise be a straightforward racing game.;
International Track & Field 2000 Review;4.7;Poor; After you've beaten the game several times, it's easy to see why Konami wanted this title to go straight to rental.;
Triple Play 2001 Review;3;Bad; Triple Play 2001 is a perfect example of how good ideas can go horribly awry.;
Dracula Resurrection Review;6;Fair; Dracula Resurrection is a somewhat interesting adventure only because it's quick, easy, and atmospheric.;
Asteroids Hyper 64 Review;4.8;Poor; Buy Asteroids Hyper 64 if you really, really adore the classic Asteroids, but all others are advised to either rent it or forget about it entirely.;
All Star Pro-Wrestling Import Review;4;Poor; IMPORT: The shoddy control scheme and sluggish gameplay are more than enough to keep the PlayStation 2's first wrestling game from being any fun.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Breath of Fire IV Review;7.5;Good; Breath of Fire IV is as solid a game as any of its predecessors.;
Chase HQ: Secret Police Review;6.9;Fair; Chase H.Q.: Secret Police is fun to play, the strategy elements are engrossing, and the level design gives the game a sense of replay rarely seen in GBC racing titles.;
Who Wants to Be a Millionaire Second Edition Review;4.2;Poor; Who Wants to Be a Millionaire doesn't have a terribly large bank of questions to choose from, and you'll probably start to recognize a few questions after only three or ...;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Mask of Zorro Review;3.5;Bad; The history of gaming is full of poor movie adaptations, and the Mask of Zorro represents one more.;
Striker Pro 2000 Review;6.6;Fair; With so much competition on the PS it's tough to recommend Striker Pro 2000 over FIFA or ISS.;
NGEN Racing Review;7.9;Good; While by no means a perfect product, NGEN does a good job of establishing an aspect of the racing genre that will obviously see many reinterpretations -here's to it being ...;
Cotton (Import) Review;7.1;Good; IMPORT: Though Cotton NGPC has lost some of the visual and audio splendor of the original, it still represents a shining example of the 2D-shooter genre.;
Trophy Bass 4 Review;8.2;Great; If you're in the market for a new fishing simulation, then Trophy Bass 4 is the game of choice.;
Striker Pro 2000 Review;6.6;Fair; Overall, this game warrants a solid score for its many attributes - decent artificial intelligence (especially the goalies), nice animation, entertaining play modes, and multiplayer. But unfortunately the automatic player-switching ...;
Earth 2150 Review;8.1;Great; Earth 2150's graphics are good, but ultimately it's the gameplay that will keep you coming back for more.;
Shogun: Total War Review;8.8;Great; Shogun has a great subject, and a perfect melding of strategic and tactical gameplay.;
Nightmare Creatures 2 Review;5.9;Mediocre; Nightmare Creatures 2 is a good idea fumbling over itself to be better.;
Gunbird 2 Review;5.8;Mediocre; If a good 16-bit shooter is what you're looking for, you could do a lot better elsewhere.;
Bomberman 64: The Second Attack Review;5.2;Mediocre; Although Bomberman 64: The Second Attack is not at all revolutionary, it is not especially well executed in any particular area, and it suffers noticeably in the graphics and sound ...;
Super Runabout: San Francisco Edition Review;5.4;Mediocre; Many games try to test your skill, but Super Runabout works to exercise your sense of frustration.;
Ground Control Review;8.5;Great; Ground Control is not only one of the best-looking tactical combat games to date, but also one that's suitably challenging and rewarding.;
Samba De Amigo Review;9;Superb; Samba De Amigo is one of the best music and rhythm games released thus far, and it's the first such game to hit the United States, making it an excellent ...;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Crystalis Review;8;Great; For a game developed more than ten years ago, Crystalis is still surprisingly relevant, and it's a testament to tight, polished RPG game design.;
Evergrace Review;5.2;Mediocre; Evergrace is just shy of average - there's nothing particularly bad here, but what little good it has is purely incidental and generally ignorable.;
Bust-A-Move 4 Review;7.2;Good; The Dreamcast has a few solid puzzle games, but Bust-A-Move 4 is neither a new breed nor a game that will push the power of your Dreamcast to impressive new ...;
Croc Review;4.4;Poor; Croc's characters are endearing, the level design is good, and the quest is both long and enjoyable. Unfortunately, the horrible control destroys the game's playability, making Croc for the Game ...;
Sky Surfer Import Review;3.9;Bad; IMPORT: Sky Surfer represents a situation where a decent concept is marred by flawed execution.;
Persona 2: Innocent Sin Import Review;9.2;Superb; IMPORT: Persona 2: Innocent Sin is a rare gem in today's RPG market - despite the popularization of the genre, it's stayed true to its offbeat roots to deliver a ...;
Test Drive Le Mans Review;8.1;Great; What you get with Test Drive Le Mans is the most solid GBC racing title to date. The features are thick, the gameplay is deep, and the level of replay ...;
1942 Review;4.5;Poor; Even though the gameplay is solid, the bland visuals and lackluster sound make 1942 a tough pill to swallow.;
Grudge Warriors Review;5.1;Mediocre; If you're deathly bored, low on funds, and sick of every game your local video store stocks, then perhaps you'll want to check out Grudge Warriors.;
Industrial Spy Review;3.3;Bad; Unless you're extremely into the spy game genre, you should avoid this game at all costs.;
Covert Ops: Nuclear Dawn Review;5.3;Mediocre; Covert Ops: Nuclear Dawn can be written off as a survival-horror game sans the horror: In place of unholy biological mutations, you have fanatical terrorists crawling around a cramped bullet ...;
Colony Wars: Red Sun Review;7.5;Good; Thanks to a greater focus on plot development and presentation, Psygnosis delivers with Red Sun what is arguably the best Colony Wars title to date.;
Rent-A-Hero No. 1 Import Review;8;Great; IMPORT: It's definitely unique and uniquely Sega, and the Dreamcast game library needs more wacky games like this - Seaman needs the company.;
40 Winks Review;4.1;Poor; 40 Winks might be a good purchase for a parent with a 6- to 10-year-old who's just starting to play video games, but other than that, anyone looking for a ...;
MDK2 Review;7.8;Good; It improves on the original's technology and expands its gameplay without losing the off-kilter sense of humor that helped make MDK so unique.;
Casper GBC Review;4.5;Poor; For children from age 5 to 12, many fun hours of friendly haunting await. For adolescents and adults, however, there are better choices in the genre.;
SimCity 3000 Unlimited Review;7.5;Good; It's best suited for those who haven't played much SimCity 3000 yet, though some of its scenario-editing features are better for hard-core SimCity fans.;
Toobin' Review;4.7;Poor; Some will be drawn to the quirky, skills-type gameplay, while others may find Toobin's innovative ideas buried under a sea of unforgiving control and limited replay value.;
Tomb Raider GBC Review;8.1;Great; As a total package, Tomb Raider for Game Boy Color delivers a degree of immersion not realized since Tomb Raider 2.;
Spec Ops: Stealth Patrol Review;4.8;Poor; Spec Ops: Stealth Patrol isn't the most spectacular game on the PlayStation, but it does deliver enough basic fundamentals like control, gameplay, and presentation to make it easily worth its ...;
Vampire: The Masquerade - Redemption Review;6.8;Fair; It's got a great premise and an ambitious design, but the game is mired by its repetitive and often frustrating combat, ill-fated design decisions, and forgettable characters and story.;
Starcraft 64 Review;8.4;Great; The huge number of levels available and the two-player split-screen mode - slowdown ridden as it is - make for an incredible amount of value.;
Gauntlet Legends DC Review;4.2;Poor; Regardless of whether the original Gauntlet game was compelling enough to warrant an arcade remake, the Dreamcast version of Gauntlet Legends is a subpar button-masher that's neither interesting nor nostalgic.;
Kurt Warner's Arena Football Unleashed - Review;5.9;Mediocre; It's a scaled-down version of Blitz 2000 with a few changes, but these changes don't really enhance the game in any way - unless you're a die-hard Arena Football fan, ...;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
PGA Championship Golf 2000 Review;8.9;Great; PGA Championship Golf 2000 is currently the unrivaled king of golf sims.;
Runabout 2 Review;5.2;Mediocre; The Runabout series not only hasn't kept up with the times (Crazy Taxi is this type of game almost fully realized), it's lost a lot of what made it so ...;
Evolva Review;7.3;Good; It's a third-person squad-based action shooter whose original design concept actually succeeds in adding to the overall quality of the game.;
Wario Land 3 Review;9.8;Superb; As far as platformers go, Wario Land 3 is a game that fires on all cylinders.;
Draconus: Cult of the Wyrm Review;8.2;Great; It's the kind of game that titles like Eidos' Deathtrap Dungeon and Universal's Xena: Warrior Princess should have been.;
Virtual On: Oratorio Tangram - Review;8.1;Great; In the end, Virtual On: Oratorio Tangram is one of the most visually impressive Dreamcast games yet, alongside Soul Calibur and Shenmue.;
Legend of Mana Review;7;Good; A string of miniquests without a cohesive core, Legend of Mana is likely to disappoint fans hoping for a new action RPG classic, but it will entertain those just looking ...;
FIFA 2001 Review;9;Superb; FIFA 2001 isn't flawless, but the game is extremely well rounded and it excels in every category.;
Rainbow Six DC Review;8.1;Great; As long as you're not expecting Quake III Arena and are ready for a steep learning curve, Rainbow Six is as deep and challenging as action games get.;
Who Wants to Be a Millionaire 2nd Edition Review;6.2;Fair; It pretty much delivers everything you'd expect from a PC version of the TV game show.;
F1 World Grand Prix Review;7.5;Good; If the game's release had been more timely and the frame rate problems minimized, it might have been a Spring blockbuster.;
Space Channel 5 Review;7;Good; Space Channel 5 absolutely oozes with style from beginning to end, and even though a bit of the game's charm has been lost in the translation from Japanese to English, ...;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Samurai Shodown: Warrior's Rage Review;3.7;Bad; One of the worst fighting games in recent memory from SNK or anyone else, Warrior's Rage offers very little for anyone but the most fanatical Samurai Shodown fans and SNK ...;
Traitors Gate Review;7.8;Good; You'll need to learn lock picking, security-code deciphering, and computer hacking;
Motocross Madness 2 Review;8.8;Great; Motocross Madness 2 isn't the most realistic motorcycle simulation you can buy, but it's definitely one of the most enjoyable.;
Marvel vs. Capcom 2 Review;8.4;Great; Fans of the off-kilter action found in the previous versus games will surely be pleased with Marvel vs. Capcom 2, as it represents the first major set of changes the ...;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Gekido Review;7.4;Good; With inviting gameplay and an abundance of hidden characters, Gekido is worthy of the acclaim given to Streets of Rage 2, Guardian Heroes, or Die Hard Arcade, provided you're a ...;
Bomberman MAX Review;8.4;Great; If you can deal with the lack of a traditional Bomberman multiplayer mode, the title makes a good candidate for your next portable game.;
Daikatana Review;4.6;Poor; Daikatana is not an unmitigated disaster - but unfortunately, that's not enough to endorse it.;
Nightmare Creatures 2 Review;5.3;Mediocre; Nightmare Creatures 2 fails miserably at its obvious attempt at creating a cross between Tomb Raider and Resident Evil.;
Grind Session Review;9.1;Superb; The game has great sound effects and an absolutely amazing soundtrack, featuring songs from artists such as Jurassic 5, GZA, Dr. Octagon, X-Ecutioners, NOFX, and Black Flag.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Flying Heroes Review;7.8;Good; Flying Heroes looks superb, but it's definitely not just another first-person shooter.;
Driver Review;7.4;Good; Driving around is fun and exciting, the levels are varied, and the side games really do improve your skill within the main game.;
Imperium Galactica II Review;8.4;Great; Not only does it look good and play well, but it also succeeds at creating a unique universe, featuring eight interesting races.;
The Road to El Dorado Review;7.3;Good; While the game's plot and gameplay are standard, it's eye-candy that El Dorado excels in. Miguel and Tulio walk, jump, crawl, and meander with countless frames of animation.;
Mr. Driller Review;6.1;Fair; Mr. Driller is a cute and quirky puzzler that lacks the variety to make it a long-term contender for your attention like a Puzzle Fighter or Tetris would. At a ...;
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater Review;9.5;Superb; Tony Hawk's Pro Skater is a classic in every sense of the word, and the Dreamcast port is the version that is best suited to stand the tests of time.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Excitebike 64 Review;8.8;Great; The gameplay is arcade-like, but it is also deep and varied in that well-known Nintendo way. The visuals aren't perfect, but they are stunning nonetheless.;
Hot Wheels Micro Racers Review;6.2;Fair; It takes the classic playtime activity of racing toy cars and adds 3D-accelerated graphics and artificial intelligence to create a fun arcade-style racing game.;
Lemmings Revolution Review;7.1;Good; The gradual learning curve, simple interface, and new features make it a great game for Lemmings novices and veterans alike.;
The New York Times Crossword Puzzles - Review;6;Fair; The New York Times Crossword Puzzles is an electronic compilation of many of the hard-copy books you can get of these famous crosswords.;
Metal Gear Solid GBC Review;9.4;Superb; Despite minor gripes, Metal Gear Solid is, without equal, the best tactical-espionage title on the Game Boy Color.;
Perfect Dark Review;9.9;Superb; As a single-player or multiplayer FPS experience Perfect Dark is unparalleled on the console systems.;
Expendable (PS) Review;6.5;Fair; When you get right down to it, Expendable is sheer, unadulterated shooting. Run through a bunch of levels, blow everything to bits, and try not to get shot.;
MediEvil II Review;7.6;Good; MediEvil II feels as though it contains all the features that Sony Cambridge wanted to fit into the original game but didn't have time to include. They're wonderfully original and ...;
0Story (Import) Review;5.8;Mediocre; IMPORT: An understanding of the Japanese language is a must, and there are a lot of cultural references in the game, which may really look odd for the American audience.;
Martian Gothic: Unification Review;5.6;Mediocre; It's a missed opportunity for those hoping for a good blend of action and adventure elements.;
Tachyon: The Fringe Review;7.5;Good; It's a fast-paced, colorful, action-packed space combat game with a branching campaign and an enjoyable story, as well as a solid multiplayer mode.;
Championship Bass Review;6.9;Fair; It gradually introduces bass-fishing techniques while stripping away long stretches of inactivity by placing you right where the big ones are biting.;
4 Wheel Thunder Review;7.3;Good; Admittedly, more multiplayer and career options would have been nice, but in a game focused directly at fun-seeking race fanatics, what's present is ample enough.;
Power Stone 2 Review;8;Great; As a four-player game, it's definitely one of the wildest fighters to come to the Dreamcast.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Rainbow Six Review;7.4;Good; If your idea of a good time is blowing things up, Metal Gear Solid or Army Men might be better choices.;
Misadventures of Tron Bonne The Review;7.7;Good; What Tron Bonne lacks in audiovisual splendor, it makes up for in fun.;
Heroes of Might and Magic III: The Shadow of Death Review;7;Good; Except for the new maps and a handful of minor gameplay changes, there's absolutely nothing in Shadow of Death that Heroes veterans haven't seen before.;
WCW Mayhem Review;6.7;Fair; WCW Mayhem marks a respectable entry for EA into the realm of handheld wrestling titles.;
StarLancer Review;7.7;Good; StarLancer is an enjoyable story-driven space combat sim that should meet, but not exceed, the lofty expectations of fans of the developers' previous games.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp;
Grand Theft Auto 2 Review;6.9;Fair; Grand Theft Auto 2 for the Dreamcast combines the feature set from the PlayStation version with the graphical sheen of the PC version.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark Review;8.8;Great; As you explore the new continent of Kunark, it'll become increasingly clear to you that the expansion's value is as immense as that of the original game.;
Rogue Spear Mission Pack: Urban Operations Review;7.2;Good; While the Rogue Spear mission pack doesn't provide a huge quantity of new maps, it does include a lot of different ways to play on them.;
Test Drive Le Mans Review;6.2;Fair; Racing aficionados should definitely check this out, if only to win bet money from their friends who don't think the driver will be able to go a whole day without ...;
Army Men: World War Review;5.8;Mediocre; What you get with Army Men World War is a decent sequel to the original Army Men 3D, but one that's only barely superior.;
Wild Arms 2 Review;5.4;Mediocre; Wild Arms 2 isn't bad, but it doesn't begin to approach today's standard of good, either.;
Urban Chaos Review;2.9;Terrible; Urban Chaos is ugly and almost completely unplayable.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
F1 2000 Review;8.4;Great; It will prove that EA Sports can produce a racing sim that's as realistic and exciting as the best racing games on the market.;
Crusaders of Might and Magic Review;6.7;Fair; Those looking for an engrossing RPG experience and a decent 3D adventure may want to check out Crusaders of Might and Magic.;
Allegiance Review;8.7;Great; Its real-time strategy elements and its focus on cooperative piloting tactics are so central to its gameplay that Allegiance can be very challenging to learn, but it's well worth the ...;
Fantavision Review;6.6;Fair; Fantavision neither revolutionizes nor damages the genre, it simply comes out somewhere in between.;
Guitar Freaks Append 2nd Mix (Import) Review;9;Superb; While the original Guitar Freaks has addictive qualities that imbue it with a nearly ungodly amount of replay value, adding 2nd Mix to it really makes the series more complete.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Q-Ball Billiards Master Review;6.6;Fair; Q-Ball Billiards Master has some things going for it in the gameplay department, and the graphics are certainly as good as, if not better than, any other console billiards game, ...;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Speed Punks Review;8.4;Great; If you're a fan of Crash Team Racing and have been looking for another fun four-player racer, or if have wondered if any of these kart games are any fun, ...;
Gunship! Review;6.7;Fair; While Gunship! is nominally a flight simulator, it's really a flight action game.;
Triple Play 2001 Review;4.6;Poor; The gameplay is uninspired, and its similarity to real-life baseball is remote at best.;
Microsoft Baseball 2001 Review;6;Fair; Unfortunately, an almost ludicrous number of bugs and flaws knock the game out of serious contention.;
Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards Review;6.9;Fair; While some might be initially put off by the youthful nature of Kirby 64, the depth of the power combo system really brings a lot to what would otherwise be ...;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Tzar: The Burden of the Crown Review;6.4;Fair; While Tzar may have borrowed a great deal from other strategy games, it failed to inherit several of those games' strategic amenities.;
Swing Away Golf Review;8.7;Great; Swing Away Golf is a game whose features and execution could barely be explained by a book, let alone by a review.;
F1 2000 Review;6.9;Fair; While it isn't the definitive F1 racing game we were hoping for, it certainly plays well, looks decent, and offers more than enough options and racing modes to keep fans ...;
Roommania #203 (Import) Review;8.1;Great; Roommania #203 is a well-made game, especially in the storytelling and sound departments.;
I.Q. Remix+: Intelligent Qube (Import) Review;6;Fair; I.Q. Remix+ fails in that it subtracts from what made the original formula so worthy, and it tries to blindside you with tons of techno trickery but fools practically no ...;
Typing of the Dead Review;8.7;Great; The concept sounds extremely strange, but in practice, Typing of the Dead is extremely fun.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Roadsters Review;4.2;Poor; Totally unrealistic physics, generic track design, and a vehicle list devoid of anything but topless roadsters make this a game to be avoided by the casual arcade-racing fan.;
Deer Hunter 3 Gold Review;7.7;Good; Deer Hunter 3 Gold is easily the best choice for a realistic hunting experience on the PC.;
Shadow Watch Review;7;Good; The game's most notable and impressive feature is the slick, hand-painted artwork that gives Shadow Watch the look and style of a graphic novel.;
Codename Eagle Review;5.7;Mediocre; Codename Eagle is a short, linear, and really goofy game that's much more frustrating than it is interesting.;
King of Fighters '99 Evolution Review;6.6;Fair; KoF Evolution is about as good a port of SNK's The King of Fighters '99 as anyone could ask for.;
Treasure Strike (Import) Review;6.3;Fair; Treasure Strike is a fun multiplayer game, but if you're a solo gamer, be warned that it's not too exciting.;
Polaris SnoCross Review;7.8;Good;" At the outset, Polaris SnoCross is an above-average racer that delivers the ""extreme"" experience, while including an oft-neglected link-play feature.";
Need for Speed: Porsche Unleashed Review;8.9;Great; Porsche Unleashed is a beautiful, comprehensive, and highly enjoyable racing sim that's suitable for just about any driving enthusiast.;
Pokemon Trading Card Review;7.6;Good; A great game for a time, Pokemon Trading Card is a faithful and amusing adaptation of the collectible card game, but it suffers as a single-player video game.;
Driving Emotion Type-S Review;7.3;Good; The game still falls well short of the level of Gran Turismo, but thanks to friendlier controls and improved handling, the US rendition of Type-S is actually a playable and ...;
Star Wars: Jedi Power Battles Review;5.4;Mediocre; Though not as ill-conceived or as badly carried out as its Episode I adventure-game kin, Jedi Power Battles still has enough problems to warrant it a game to be avoided.;
Test Drive Le Mans Review;6.7;Fair; Test Drive Le Mans should be more than enough to keep arcade-racing fans happy for a while at least.;
Ka-52 Team Alligator Review;5.6;Mediocre; Team Alligator's stripped-down flight model is a spectacular failure that taints all other parts of the game.;
MLB 2001 Review;8.7;Great; Pacing and sound issues aside, 989 Studios has fixed many of the glaring flaws of last year's release and as such has created a game superior to EA's offering.;
Beetle Buggin' Review;6.9;Fair; Its varied courses and vehicles enhance its replay value and will keep casual gamers coming back for more.;
All-Star Baseball 2001 Review;9.2;Superb; While ASB 2001 makes the most of the N64's graphical capabilities, the same can't be said for the game's sound quality.;
Tekken Tag Tournament Review;9.6;Superb; If you've stayed away from the Tekken series for a long time, Tekken Tag is a very warm homecoming, delivering the same solid gameplay that Tekken fans crave in large ...;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Star Wars: Episode I Racer Review;7.5;Good; While it doesn't come close to tapping the graphic and audio capabilities of the system, the gameplay is still very solid, and it fills the futuristic racing niche for the ...;
Messiah Review;6;Fair; Messiah is relatively short, and the memorable set pieces are interrupted by too many uninspired jumping puzzles.;
Yoda Stories Review;1.8;Abysmal; Sadly, there is no reason for anyone to play through Yoda Stories.;
Risk II Review;8;Great; Risk II not only stays faithful to the original gameplay, but it also presents some pleasant new spins on the classic Risk formula.;
Mobil 1 Rally Championship Review;5.8;Mediocre; In terms of an overall package, EA's V-Rally 2 and Colin McRae have much more to offer than Mobil 1.;
Last Call Review;6.7;Fair; Last Call is a fast-paced, entertaining, and humorous game for adults that can teach the casual player some fun drink recipes.;
Eagle One: Harrier Attack Review;4.9;Poor; Eagle One does have its problems, but in the end, it's not a total loss.;
Carmageddon Review;3.1;Bad; What one gets with Carmageddon is a game where every pro is met by an equally matched con.;
Walt Disney World: Magical Racing Quest Review;7.7;Good; Magical Racing Tour has more than enough style - and it offers a different enough experience - to make the game worthwhile.;
Soldier of Fortune Review;7.7;Good; The single-player mode is a long series of often-amazingly intense firefights.;
Army Men Review;6.9;Fair; Taken as a whole, Army Men is an enjoyable game that delivers the pleasingly nostalgic experience of plastic-soldier warfare.;
Jeremy McGrath Supercross 2000 Review;5.5;Mediocre;" ""Was this really necessary?"" is the question that Acclaim's Jeremy McGrath Supercross 2000 begs.";
MDK2 Review;8.3;Great; Despite its few flaws, MDK 2 is a great first effort by BioWare, and it's a better game than the original.;
Alundra 2 Review;4;Poor; While it's true that almost all games are created as profit machines, some transcend - Alundra 2 is an unkind reminder that pulls us back into the base clay.;
Mission: Impossible Review;5.2;Mediocre; Mission: Impossible seems geared to those hard-core gamers out there who have both the time and the patience to spend replaying level after level until they've finished the game.;
Micro Machines 1 and 2: Twin Turbo Review;8.8;Great; Unlike recent games that attempt to imitate the gameplay and style of Micro Machines, Micro Machines 1 and 2: Twin Turbo proves that nothing can improve on a series that ...;
Romance of the Three Kingdoms VI: Awakening of the Dragon Review;6.5;Fair; While ROT3K6 won't win anyone over with its graphics, it is a solid and intricate simulation title.;
Sammy Sosa High Heat Baseball 2001 Review;5.4;Mediocre; The gameplay is decent, many of last year's aggravating flaws are nowhere to be found, and the general feel of a baseball game is present.;
NASCAR 2000 Review;7;Good; It's an alternative for gamers more interested in down-and-dirty stock-car action than in perfect realism.;
Star Trek: Armada Review;7.9;Good; It's an impressive real-time strategy game that borrows action and gameplay elements from many of the genre's classics.;
Vanark Review;6.9;Fair; In the end, Vanark is a really good game. Unfortunately, it's a really good game that lasts for two to three hours.;
Last Blade The Review;7.6;Good; The Last Blade is a good fighting game, with more options and features than you'd expect from a portable fighter.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater Review;7.1;Good; Though there's much room for improvement, Tony Hawk Pro Skater is easily the best skateboarding game available for the Game Boy Color.;
Croc 2 Review;5.8;Mediocre; Croc 2 provides enough consistent gameplay to avoid outright dismissal, but it clearly lacks the imaginative spark necessary to make playing it a memorable experience.;
CyberTiger Review;3.8;Bad; If you are a novice or a serious N64 gamer who wants a fun, fantasy-style title that still plays like an earnest game of golf, check out Mario Golf or ...;
Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation Review;5.4;Mediocre; Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation reeks of a heartless cash-in and the game, for lack of a better term, simply has no soul.;
Battlezone: Rise of the Black Dogs Review;7.3;Good; Battlezone: Rise of the Black Dogs is a fun game with good looks that fails to deliver in terms of multiplayer support and audio quality.;
Championship Bass Review;6.1;Fair; Although it lacks enough bells and whistles to snag mainstream gamers who aren't into the sport, it packs enough excitement to warrant long-term commitment by fishing fans.;

Thief II: The Metal Age Review;8.6;Great; The mission design is more consistent than the original's, and some of the missions are among the best in any action game to date.;
BattleTanx: Global Assault Review;5.5;Mediocre; Instead of playing to the PlayStation's abilities, this port tries to match the N64 version as much as it can, without improving the areas where it could exceed it.;

Umihara Kawase: Shun - Second Edition (Import) Review;7.7;Good; Umihara Kawase: Shun is a strange, unique, aquatic platformer with chiefly 2D graphics - it's hardly marketable anywhere in the world.;

Dragon Valor Review;5.6;Mediocre; The branching family tree adds a measure of replay value, but the game is average enough that few will want to play it through more than once.;
Battlezone II: Combat Commander Review;6.6;Fair; The designers have neutralized the fast pacing and complex mechanics that made the first game so much fun.;
Street Fighter EX2 Plus Review;7.6;Good; While EX2 Plus adds a few features and some new characters to the mix, it doesn't really have the overall flair that made the first game stand out.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Virtual On: Oratorio Tangram (Import) Review;7;Good; Keep in mind that if this review were based on time spent with the standard Dreamcast controller alone, the score would go down by at least three full points. If ...;
Tech Romancer Review;8.6;Great; A game that carries the level of polish, playability, and fun that Tech Romancer does deserves to see a handful of sequels, each building on the mythos established here.;
Wall Street Trader 2000 Review;7.1;Good; The developers made a very impressive attempt to make a financial simulator that's worthy of being called a game.;
Tee Off Review;7.1;Good; Golf fans with a DC hooked up to their television will surely have a good time with the game, even though it isn't quite as compelling as similar games appearing ...;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
South Park: Chef's Luv Shack Review;4;Poor; Its lame minigames, lack of varied speech, and generally slow pace make for short-lived fun at best.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Silent Bomber Review;8.2;Great; While the two-player mode could use some help and is more of a throwaway feature, the single-player mode is worth every penny.;
Full Strength Strongman Competition Review;2.3;Terrible; Even if you think this stuff is fun the first time around, there's no way any event in the game can hold its appeal for more than a few go-rounds.;
South Park Rally Review;3.9;Bad; South Park fans may want to rent this game, but it's far too limited to consider for purchase.;
Koudelka Review;6.7;Fair; Overall, Koudelka falls short of expectations in the gameplay department, but the beautiful CG work in the game's movies definitely makes the experience a memorable one.;
Jackie Chan's Stuntmaster Review;6.7;Fair; Jackie Chan's Stuntmaster is a solid game, but from a technological standpoint, it's a bit behind the pack.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Tomba! 2 Review;8.4;Great; Fans of the original game are in for a treat, but not enough has changed to make the game attractive to those who didn't click with the original.;
Bassmasters 2000 Review;7.9;Good; This game will definitely please any angler, whether a real-life bass-fishing expert or a beginner looking for some practice.;
Parasite Eve II Review;7.3;Good; Parasite Eve II is a consistently good-looking action-adventure game that adopts its predecessor's cinematic style to an even more impressive effect.;
Broken Sword II Review;6.9;Fair; Broken Sword II is a wonderful throwback to the classic Sierra-style adventure game and is a great adventure for fans of the style.;
Virtual Pool Hall Review;8.2;Great; It's basically just Virtual Pool 2 with a handful of enhancements.;
MindRover: The Europa Project Review;8;Great; It's an innovative strategy game with puzzle elements that puts the task of artificial-intelligence programming in your hands.;
Tenchu: Shinobi Hyakusen (Import) Review;5.5;Mediocre; It's simply a collection of levels with no coherent connection to each other, delivering little sense of progress as you work your way through.;
Chrono Cross Review;10;Essential; Chrono Cross may not have had the largest budget, but it has the largest heart.;
Shanghai: Second Dynasty Review;7.1;Good; Second Dynasty's colorful graphics, soothing music, and encompassing array of both mah-jongg and shanghai variants are reason enough to recommend it.;
Tales of the Sunrise Heroes (Import) Review;4.6;Poor; Do yourself a favor and buy an art book instead.;
Bangai-O Review;8.5;Great; Dreamcast owners craving a genuinely compelling gameplay experience would do well to check out Bangai-O.;
Descent 3 Mercenary Review;6;Fair; Its few good points are overshadowed by its generally bland level design and a lack of new features.;
Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2000 Review;5.5;Mediocre; Even Tiger Woods himself can't save Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2000 from being a game so bland that even the most immobile of golf fans will rather dust off their ...;
Hoyle Word Games Review;7.5;Good; The success of Hoyle Word Games is in its simplicity.;
Wild Wild West: The Steel Assassin Review;5.1;Mediocre; Considering how bad movie-licensed games have been in the past, Wild Wild West could have been a lot worse.;
Y2K: The Game Review;6.7;Fair; Its technical problems are a real shame, because when it comes to every other aspect of game design, Y2K is actually quite good.;
Formula 1 99 Review;7.7;Good; Formula One 99 has great control and enough settings to keep any longtime fan of the Formula One series glued to the TV for quite some time.;
Urban Chaos Review;8.3;Great; The fact that Urban Chaos is an enjoyable third-person action game with no switch flipping, box pushing, or key finding should be reason enough for you to purchase it.;
Vandal Hearts II Review;7;Good; While Vandal Hearts II lacks the grand feel of Final Fantasy Tactics, it is a solid and rewarding strategy-RPG.;
Shenmue Review;7.8;Good; Indeed, while Shenmue is revolutionary, the game is far from perfect.;
Puyo Puyo Da! (Import) Review;2.3;Terrible; You can pick up Puyo Puyo Da! and be completely fed up with it within an hour.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
International Track and Field 2000 Review;6.9;Fair; If you're a fan of multiplayer games, this is definitely one to check out.;
MechWarrior 3: Pirate's Moon Expansion Pack Review;7.2;Good; MechWarrior 3 players who found the original game's campaign short or uninspired will find Pirate's Moon to be all too familiar.;
D2 Review;6.2;Fair; Kenji Eno has created one of the most engaging stories of all time and given it support in every way possible, except the one that matters most: gameplay.;
No Fear Downhill Mountain Biking Review;5;Mediocre; No Fear Downhill Mountain Biking tiptoes the line of being a good racing game.;
Vigilante 8: Second Offense Review;7.7;Good; Combining the fantastic audio from the PlayStation edition, the four-player mode offered on the Nintendo 64, and the graphical advances you expect from the Dreamcast, this version of V8SO is ...;
Pro Pinball: Fantastic Journey Review;7.5;Good; An accurate simulation of a somewhat generic pinball table isn't quite as impressive as it used to be.;
Crusaders of Might and Magic Review;5.5;Mediocre; If the game were any longer, you'd start getting really tired of its numerous shortcomings and even more frustrated that its good ingredients are only half-baked.;
Street Fighter III Double Impact Review;7.2;Good; There is definitely a lot to Street Fighter III.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Spellbinder: The Nexus Conflict Review;7.5;Good; Mythic has tempered what would otherwise be a solid but unremarkable shooter with a number of role-playing game elements that make Spellbinder surprisingly deep and distinctive.;
Bass Rise Review;5;Mediocre; Bass Rise makes for an amusing diversion best suited for casual fishing fans who generally play for no longer than an hour per sitting.;
Test Drive 6 Review;4.6;Poor; It was sort of weak on the PlayStation. On the Dreamcast it's a primped-up clone of a sort-of-weak game.;
MiG Alley Review;9.2;Superb; Dogfighting in MiG Alley is one of the best experiences a virtual pilot can hope for.;
Worms Armageddon Review;7.8;Good; Worms Armageddon is designed so you can play with other people, and the single-player match is really no substitute.;
Space Invaders Review;3.3;Bad; Space Invaders is a game different enough to cancel any feelings of nostalgia, yet it isn't good enough to stand on its own.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Fighting Force 2 Review;3.5;Bad; There's really nothing exciting about Fighting Force 2.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Supercross 2000 Review;4.7;Poor; Control issues and dodgy graphics plant Supercross 2000 firmly behind 989 Sports' recent addition to the genre, Supercross Circuit.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
NBA Jam 2000 Review;5.6;Mediocre; Dedicated games like NBA Showtime and NBA Live 2000 do a much better job of representing their respective schools of video-game basketball.;
NFL Quarterback Club 2000 Review;2.4;Terrible; Quarterback Club 2000 is a buggy, problem-ridden football game that should be avoided by all football video game fans.;
Close Combat: Battle of the Bulge Review;8.2;Great; Battle of the Bulge will appeal both to Close Combat veterans and to those simply looking for a good real-time strategy game with historical overtones.;
Missile Command Review;4;Poor; Missile Command is just another piece of proof that remakes are never as good as their originals.;
NBA Shootout 2000 Review;8.1;Great; Its clean graphics and great control not only make it the best installment in the Shootout series but also one of the best basketball games for the PlayStation.;
Dukes of Hazzard: Racing for Home Review;4.9;Poor; The Dukes of Hazzard: Racing For Home could have been an outstanding game, but the game is simply too easy and way too buggy to succeed.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Touring Car Challenge Review;8.2;Great; All its problems are alleviated by the excitement and sheer fun that Touring Car Challenge has to offer.;
Fighting Force 2 Review;3.6;Bad; Fighting Force 2 takes the same basic beat-'em-up ethic and melds it with a pinch of Lara Croftian camera work and a smidgen of Metal Gear-esque espionage.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Diplomacy Review;4;Poor; Not only is the interface clunky and awkward, but the artificial intelligence is terrible, and the multiplayer support is buggy.;
Roadsters Trophy Review;4.8;Poor; If you're itching to feel the breeze in your hair as you jam through a country track in your drop-top roadster, you may want to give this one a rental.;
Boombots Review;1.9;Abysmal; Boombots is without a doubt in the running for the worst game of the year.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Planescape: Torment Review;9;Superb; It's clearly the best traditional computer role-playing game of the year and is bound to be an all-time favorite for many of its inevitable fans.;
Nuclear Strike Review;6.8;Fair; Just start out playing it on the hard difficulty to ensure you get your money's worth.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
NASCAR Legends Review;9;Superb; NASCAR Legends is the only game for nostalgic NASCAR fans to turn to.;
Q*Bert Review;3.6;Bad; The game just doesn't have enough substance to last more than a day.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Konami Arcade Classics Review;7;Good; The collection is a relatively low-frills compilation, but the quality of the games more than makes up for a deficiency in the history department.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Xena: Warrior Princess - The Talisman of Fate Review;2.8;Terrible; This would probably make a decent party game for players who don't know how to do anything more than mash every button available, but fans of fighting games should stay ...;
Harvest Moon 64 Review;7.3;Good; Though admittedly not for everyone, Harvest Moon 64 is a strangely compelling, original little game that makes hours melt away incomprehensibly.;
12 O'Clock High: Bombing the Reich Review;6.8;Fair; 12 O'Clock High is a meticulously researched wargame that unfortunately doesn't add up.;
Rocket: Robot on Wheels Review;7.6;Good; Its gameplay is diverse yet solid, and it all combines to form a game that will keep you interested for quite some time.;
Virtua Striker 2 Review;4.7;Poor; Virtua Striker 2 is a classic example of good ideas gone horribly wrong.;
Asheron's Call Review;8.6;Great; Asheron's Call is a solid, well-rounded online role-playing experience that's at least as good as any other out there.;
SWAT 3: Close Quarters Battle Review;8.3;Great; SWAT 3's most impressive feature has to be the amazing artificial intelligence employed by friend and foe alike.;
Re-Volt Review;5.3;Mediocre; Re-Volt on the Dreamcast is clearly the best version of the three home editions, but it still remains an evilly unforgiving game.;
Abomination Review;6.5;Fair; It's a real-time tactical action game with very little underlying strategy.;
Quake III Arena Review;9.2;Superb; Quake III Arena provides the ultimate deathmatch experience.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Gran Turismo 2 Review;8.5;Great; Fans of the original and those looking for a pure driving simulation should flock to store shelves without delay, but for the rest, that add-on philosophy may not sit well.;
Supercross 2000 Review;6.2;Fair; Turning problems aside, the game features a pretty nice physics model, and the bikes buckle and bounce in a realistic fashion after big jumps.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Worms Armageddon Review;7.9;Good; Although the game has its weak points, the solid gameplay and simple control make this game a must-have for anyone who likes to play games with other humans.;
Plasma Sword Review;6.6;Fair; A severe lack of technological upgrades and cookie-cutter character design make this a tough game to recommend.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Odium Review;5.9;Mediocre; Odium is a role-playing game without any puzzles and a tactical combat game with a repetitive, maddening, and simplistic battle engine.;
Front Mission 3 Review;8.3;Great; Ironically, the first game in the Front Mission trilogy to arrive in North America may actually be the best one to introduce the series to a new audience.;
Castlevania: Legacy of Darkness Review;7.3;Good; Complaints aside, Castlevania: Legacy of Darkness is exactly what it sets out to be: a better version of the original.;
MTV Music Generator Review;7;Good; You'll realize right away that the ideal setting for intense music creation is not the 2MB RAM PlayStation.;
Shadow Man Review;6.7;Fair; Shadow Man for the Dreamcast is truly the only console version of the game that isn't a chore to play.;
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure Review;8;Great;" The fighting in Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is a wild combination of typical Capcom ""versus"" games, like Marvel vs. Capcom, combined with screen-filling over-the-top super-attacks like those found in Arc System's ...";
Maken X Review;7.9;Good; Maken X would make a great addition to an already strong library.;
Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000 Review;8.7;Great; If you have the hardware to run it, this simulation really stands out.;
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure Review;8.3;Great; Jojo's Bizarre Adventure offers fine-tuned Capcom quality with a twist, along with a unique storyline and great control.;
ChuChu Rocket Review;8.2;Great; In short, Sonic Team has created a party experience for the ages - like Bomberman, the best idea is to grab a bunch of friends and go head-to-head.;
Unreal Tournament Review;9.5;Superb; Unreal Tournament is the most complete first-person shooter available.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Gabriel Knight 3: Blood of the Sacred Blood of the Damned Review;6.7;Fair; It has several problems that will dampen the experience for all but the most die-hard fans of the series.;
Lego Racers Review;4.6;Poor; With bland gameplay, boring racing and a frustrating Lego construction system, Lego Racers just translates into an incomplete package.;
Gigawing Review;4.4;Poor; Gigawing began as a CPS2 arcade game, and the difficulty that stems from these arcade roots is apparent - this game is impossible.;
Nerf ArenaBlast Review;7;Good; The game's well-designed levels and novel game types make it a fun alternative to its more visceral inspirations.;
Ultima IX: Ascension Review;6.4;Fair; Ultima IX comes across both as an epic and a farce.;
Armada Review;7.8;Good; While Armada isn't for everyone, it is unique, fun, and original.;
Glover Review;4.8;Poor; Glover, despite its interesting play mechanics, seems to have lost its soul in the port from the N64.;
Toy Story 2 Review;6.5;Fair; Whether you've seen the movie or not, Toy Story 2, as a game, stands on its own because it offers gameplay.;
Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation Review;7.4;Good; The Last Revelation is far and away the best of the sequels, mainly because Core has finally added some coherence to all aspects of the game.;
Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine Review;6.3;Fair; Quirky controls, repetitive puzzles, and a range of other annoying flaws keep this game from being the major-league hit that Indiana Jones fans hoped it would be.;
Toy Story 2 Review;7.1;Good; Whether you've seen the movie or not, Toy Story 2, as a game, stands on its own;
Elemental Gimmick Gear Review;6.8;Fair; If you're into games like The Legend of Zelda, Beyond Oasis, Alundra, or the original Legacy of Kain, then consider picking this one up.;
Armorines: Project Swarm Review;5.4;Mediocre; Armorines is, in many ways, all the things you didn't like about Turok 2 and little of what you did like.;
Pong Review;4.5;Poor; Few people are likely to get a thrill out of playing the original Pong anymore, and, unfortunately, the Pong of the new generation doesn't do much better.;
Dune 2000 Review;5.3;Mediocre; Basically a port of the PC version, Dune 2000 is lackluster at best, because it is a port of a lackluster PC game.;
You Don't Know Jack Review;7.4;Good; It's definitely a great multiplayer party-style game.;
Star Trek: Hidden Evil Review;4.5;Poor; Hidden Evil is yet another in the long line of Star Trek games that fail to deliver on the potential of their license.;
NCAA Final Four 2000 Review;7.8;Good; While NCAA Final Four 2000 isn't by any means the best basketball game for the PlayStation, it is a sound college basketball game.;
Guitar Freaks (Import) Review;8.8;Great; Guitar Freaks is a game of remarkable order that no true collection can be complete without.;
Test Drive 6 Review;4.7;Poor; Poor design, bad graphics, and flawed gameplay mar what could otherwise have been an incredibly fun game.;
Sid Meier's Antietam! Review;8.5;Great; It offers no dramatic graphics overhaul or drastic redesign - just a new setting, new subject matter, and more of the same great Civil War strategy.;
Age of Wonders Review;8.6;Great; Age of Wonders encompasses many facets of games that have preceded it, but it adds improvements of its own and is consequently a complex and highly evolved strategy game.;
Centipede Review;5.5;Mediocre; While it's slightly better than its PlayStation brother, Centipede is still only average, at best.;
Test Drive: Off-Road 3 Review;4.3;Poor; Test Drive: Off-Road 3 suffers from too many issues for it to warrant anything more than a passing glance.;
Rayman 2: The Great Escape Review;9.3;Superb; Unlike many other flashy games, Rayman 2's excellence extends to its relentlessly inventive gameplay.;
Mission: Impossible Review;4.4;Poor; Compared with more recent spy games for the PlayStation, Mission: Impossible just doesn't stand up.;
Hype - The Time Quest Review;8;Great; Hype is a polished and enjoyable 3D action-adventure.;
Shadow Man Review;4.4;Poor; If you're dead set on experiencing this title, you'd be better off going with the N64 version, or maybe even wait for the Dreamcast release.;
South Park: Chef's Luv Shack Review;3.9;Bad; The repeating questions, repeating speech, and dull minigames keep it from being a game you'd want to pop in whenever you need a simple party-style game.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
NHL Championship 2000 Review;8;Great; Fox Sports has created a fun game that gives serious hockey fans more of the realism they demand.;
Test Drive 6 Review;5.2;Mediocre; TD6's mock-serious approach to arcade-style racing should warrant nothing more than a rental.;
Namco Museum 64 Review;7.4;Good; It's likely that you'll find at least one game among the six that will make the collection worth picking up for you, but it could certainly be all of them.;
NBA Basketball 2000 Review;5.1;Mediocre; Anyone looking for a serious hoops simulation should look elsewhere.;
South Park: Chef's Luv Shack Review;3.9;Bad; The lame minigames, lack of varied speech, and generally slow pace of the game make it short-lived fun at best.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
The Wheel of Time Review;8.7;Great; It is an extremely solid action game built on an excellent story and dressed up with stunning graphics.;
South Park: Chef's Luv Shack Review;3.9;Bad; The repeating questions, repeating speech, and dull minigames keep it from being a game you'd want to pop in whenever you need a simple party-style game.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Nations: WWII Fighter Command Review;5.6;Mediocre; Nations' flight model will instantly turn off those looking for a realistic flight sim, while the box description might turn away those looking for a more accessible game.;
Interstate '82 Review;6.2;Fair; Where Interstate '76 was cohesive and involving, Interstate '82 feels unfocused and generic.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Napoleon 1813 Review;6.7;Fair; Napoleon 1813 is a game that is long on innovation but critically short on polish and tuning.;
Planet Laika (Import) Review;6.1;Fair; Know that a clear understanding of Japanese is a must for Planet Laika, so it might be worth waiting to find out whether Enix intends to bring the game to ...;
Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation Review;6;Fair; It is an acceptable game based on its own merits, but, set against its own legacy, it is for all intents and purposes indistinguishable from those that have come before ...;
Zombie Revenge Review;5.7;Mediocre; Does the fact that Sega has added exclusive home-only features mean that Zombie Revenge is much more than a gussied-up arcade port? Not exactly.;
Half-Life: Opposing Force Review;9;Superb; The official expansion for the genre-redefining Half-Life in turn sets a new standard of quality for future action-game mission packs.;
Warpath: Jurassic Park Review;4.7;Poor; Much like elevator doors pause before closing, after you hit the button, so, too, does Warpath when you press, say, the bite button.;
Test Drive: Off-Road 3 Review;6.3;Fair; Test Drive: Off-Road 3 demanded a lot more attention to detail than its developers actually invested.;
Sid Meier's Alien Crossfire Review;8.3;Great; While Alien Crossfire's core game is still very much the same as its predecessor's, the new factions, technologies, and projects increase that core game's depth.;
NBA Basketball 2000 Review;7.6;Good; NBA Basketball 2000 is a great first effort from Fox Interactive, but, unfortunately, it looks better than it plays.;
Paper Boy 64 Review;5.4;Mediocre; While a decent game on its own, Paper Boy 64 doesn't capture the magic of the original arcade game.;
Turok: Rage Wars Review;5.8;Mediocre; Even on the most difficult setting, the bot AI can't stand up to any steady-handed human player.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Soul Fighter Review;4.8;Poor; Playing Soul Fighter is a chore, thanks to tedious gameplay and even worse control.;
Killer Loop Review;6.1;Fair;" Killer Loop has enough differences to give it its own identity, ruining perfectly good lines such as ""Wipeout done by a cover band.""";
SimTheme Park Review;8;Great; Despite its amusing setting and visual appeal, SimTheme Park is at heart a business simulation.;
Omikron: The Nomad Soul Review;6;Fair; Omikron's purported innovation and originality amount to nothing more than the senseless combination of unrelated but very familiar play styles.;
X-Files Review;4.2;Poor; If you find that the game's storyline hooks you, and you don't mind the interface, keep it for a couple of extra days and beat it, since the game only ...;
NBA Live 2000 Review;8.1;Great; Live 2000 is just as good as Live 99, but at best it's an iterative update to the classic PC sports series.;
V-Rally 2: Presented by Need For Speed Review;7.9;Good; With an arcade mode for casual rally fans, a downright hard-core mode for the true rally fans, and everything in between, V-Rally 2 is the premiere PlayStation rally game.;
Septerra Core: Legacy of the Creator Review;6.7;Fair; It's got some interesting characters, a user-friendly interface, and an intriguing magic system, but it gets bogged down by both minor and major problems.;
Deer Hunt Challenge Review;7.5;Good; Deer Hunt Challenge is one hunting sim that fans will want to add to their collection.;
NBA Live 2000 Review;8.2;Great; Fans of previous versions of Live will have a good time.;
Robbit Mon Dieu (Import) Review;5.4;Mediocre; Robbit Mon Dieu has the world right, but it lacks the technology and gameplay to make people actually want to play in it.;
NBA Showtime: NBA on NBC Review;6.8;Fair; Give it a three-day rental, and see if you're left hungry for more.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Tomorrow Never Dies Review;5.7;Mediocre; Tomorrow Never Dies isn't a particularly bad game, but it's definitely one you might want to consider renting instead of buying.;
Threads of Fate Review;7.9;Good; Expert RPG fans will likely blow straight through this game without a single setback.;
Vigilante 8: Second Offense Review;7.5;Good; If only a few more tunes could've been included in V8SO, the audio side could be considered flawless.;
Resident Evil 2 Review;8.9;Great; If you've already played the PlayStation or PC versions of RE2, there's really no reason to buy this game, but for N64 owners who haven't tried yet, it's an absolute ...;
Slave Zero Review;6.9;Fair; The missing elements that keep it from being the great and innovative game it once appeared to be don't necessarily preclude it from being a perfectly acceptable arcade game.;
Vigilante 8: Second Offense Review;7.7;Good; The graphics in V8SO look much the same as in the last game, save for more impressive explosions, a few minor bits of eye candy, and a greater variety of ...;
NBA Showtime: NBA on NBC Review;6.8;Fair; It's not perfect, but NBA Showtime is still a fun four-player game, and it's worlds better than any other arcade basketball game on the PlayStation.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Donkey Kong 64 Review;9;Superb; Those of you who remotely liked Mario 64 or Banjo-Kazooie will be excited to the point of numbness by this game.;
NBA Live 2000 Review;7.4;Good; Fans of previous versions of Live N64 will have a good time.;
Panzer Elite Review;8.1;Great; Panzer Elite is without a doubt the most realistic 1940s tank sim yet released.;
Flanker 2.0 Review;8.7;Great; Just observing the aircraft in flight, especially at high altitude with contrails streaming, is enough to evoke admiration for what the developers have achieved.;
Ballistic Review;6.7;Fair; Despite the simplistic nature of the game and sheer mediocrity of many of the game elements, Ballistic is still a fairly fun puzzle game with a refreshingly new premise.;
Ready 2 Rumble Boxing Review;6.7;Fair; While the Nintendo 64 version of R2R puts on a decent show, the game is a bit on the sluggish side.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
NBA Showtime: NBA on NBC Review;7.5;Good; NBA Showtime is a fun game, but its longevity is directly linked to the number of friends you have who are interested in the game.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Bugs Bunny: Lost in Time Review;6.1;Fair; At its heart lies a fun little platform game that truly does justice to Bugs Bunny.;
NFL Blitz 2000 Review;4.8;Poor; It has a few major problems that make it all but unplayable.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Supercross Circuit Review;7.7;Good; The thing that really sets SuperCross Circuit apart from other dirt-bike games is its speed.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Spec Ops II: Green Berets Review;5.6;Mediocre; The squad-based combat genre that had quickly moved far beyond Spec Ops is now even farther ahead of its sequel.;
NBA Courtside 2 Featuring Kobe Bryant Review;7.1;Good; The arcade mode is a huge bonus that by itself is almost worth the price of the game.;
Time Stalkers Review;5.2;Mediocre; While Time Stalkers' story is passable enough, its contradictory dungeon, battle, and experience system undermines any hope you may have had of enjoying this game.;
Ready 2 Rumble Boxing Review;7.3;Good; The ability it gives you to throw your own combos surpasses the combo system used in Knockout Kings 2000;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Nocturne Review;7;Good; Its movie-like quick camera cuts make the game especially difficult to navigate, which makes Nocturne's incessant and clumsy action sequences even less enjoyable.;
Rippin' Riders Review;6.5;Fair; Rippin' Riders does look and sound very nice but has major issues in the control department and feels incomplete.;
Twisted Metal 4 Review;7.1;Good; Twisted Metal 4 is as huge a leap ahead of Twisted Metal III as the second was to the original.;
Earthworm Jim 3D Review;6.3;Fair; The tragic thing is that, despite the excellent control, the camera seems to be on a kamikaze mission to destroy the game.;
Thrasher: Skate and Destroy Review;8.1;Great; If you're finished with Tony Hawk, and you're hungry for another challenge, Thrasher: Skate and Destroy is the meal you're looking for.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Links LS 2000 Review;7.9;Good; Its additional features are so unimpressive that there's not much reason for owners of the previous version to get excited.;

Kingpin: Life of Crime Review;7.3;Good; Whether the prerelease infamy and the embarrassment of disclaimers are a result of the current political climate or conscious hyperbole by the Interplay marketing machine, they tend to overshadow what ...;
Tarzan Review;7.8;Good; Even if movie-license games turn you off, this game is an exception and worth taking a look at.;
F-16 Aggressor Review;6.5;Fair; The real shame of it is there is a fine, fine flight simulator at the core of Aggressor.;
Next Tetris The Review;7;Good; I'd recommend this game to anyone looking for a new Tetris fix - it's definitely different enough from the other versions to warrant a purchase.;
Shattered Light Review;3.8;Bad; A good adventure can overcome shoddy graphics or a clunky interface with an imaginative plot and interesting gameplay. Shattered Light, unfortunately, has neither.;
Bugs Bunny: Lost in Time Review;7.8;Good; This game really does a great job of capturing the wacky humor that Looney Tunes is so famous for and, as such, is a whole lot of fun.;

Extreme Boards & Blades Review;5.5;Mediocre; It actually manages to deliver a fair dose of fun - though not necessarily for the long run, and not necessarily for everyone.;
Need for Speed: High Stakes Review;8.6;Great; It plays very much like Need for Speed III, but with some extra play modes and one big added feature.;
Driver Review;7.7;Good; Driver is a game that might be mediocre in its presentation but more than makes up for it in its gameplay and concept.;

Command & Conquer Review;7.6;Good; Aside from the frame rate problem, the game's control is well thought out and is definitely the best implementation of RTS-style control on a console controller to date.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Expendable Review;7;Good; Expendable is a refreshing blast of arcade gaming that never seems to get old.;

Fatal Fury: Wild Ambition Review;6.1;Fair; All in all, the game is still quite fun, despite the graphical letdown.;
The Operational Art of War II: Modern Battles 1956 - 2000 Review;8.7;Great; The Operational Art of War II is a continuation and enhancement, not a radical revision, of designer Norm Koger's ambitious operational wargame.;
Descent 3 Review;9;Superb; It improves in almost every conceivable way on its predecessors and reestablishes the series as the premier example of the play style it single-handedly pioneered.;
Fighting Steel Review;5.6;Mediocre; The game's best features are all but lost behind a poorly designed interface, insidious crash bugs, and a handful of design flaws.;
Shadowgate 64: Trial of the Four Towers Review;4.6;Poor; The lack of any prolonged contact with other characters in the game and the repetitive musical score doesn't only make the game feel boring but lonely as well.;
Tonic Trouble Review;3;Bad; If this game is remembered at all, it will be as the game that's not Rayman 2.;
Ace Combat 3: Electrosphere Review;6.2;Fair; While early adopters of the import version might have had a lot to look forward to in the US release, Ace Combat 3: Electrosphere arrives on our fair shores gutted ...;
Rising Zan: The Samurai Gunman Review;6.5;Fair; Is America really ready for the world's first noodle Western?;

Star Trek: The Next Generation - Birth of the Federation Review;7.9;Good; Birth of the Federation is a good game, if you are willing to forgive the interface and the amount of micromanagement required.;
Boss Rally Review;5;Mediocre; I've never had this much trouble making a car go where I wanted it to.;
Links Extreme Review;5.6;Mediocre; The problem isn't that the concept isn't good or that the game couldn't have been fun, it's that Access and Microsoft took a good idea and ran all of about ...;
World Driver Championship Review;5.7;Mediocre; World Driver Championship is an average racing game with exceptional graphics.;
Warzone 2100 Review;6.5;Fair; The best thing is its high level of customizability.;
Fighter Maker Review;6.4;Fair; The joy achieved from creating a nice-looking kick is short lived once you realize the countless hours of mundane tweaking you spent creating it.;
Extreme Winter Sports Review;2.7;Terrible; About the only thing Extreme Winter Sports really succeeds at is to remind you of how much better other snowing and skiing games are than this lifeless sim.;
Castrol Honda Superbike Review;3.8;Bad; It isn't a horrible game, but other than offering a strong simulation aspect, there's not much there.;
Sports Car GT Review;8.2;Great; When you slam the pedal to the floor and kick one of these high-priced monstersinto first gear, you will feel like you're out on the track bumping andscraping with the ...;
Ape Escape Review;8.8;Great; Ape Escape is one of the PlayStation's finest development efforts, one that shouldn't be overlooked because of its silly storyline and title.;

Austin Powers: Operation Trivia Review;3.8;Bad; Although the game starts on a fun and promising note, Operation Trivia quicklycomes to resemble one of Dr. Evil's botched plots to take over the world.;
Suzuki Alstare Extreme Racing Review;6;Fair;" This one says ""rental"" all over it.";
Aliens versus Predator Review;8.3;Great; Where the game deviates from the norm, and succeeds beyond expectations, is in its rendering of three distinct viewpoints and its effective re-creation of the film series' unrelieved sense of ...;
Dynamite Cop Review;6.1;Fair; If you've beaten Dynamite Cop in arcades there's no real reason to buy the game.;
Baldur's Gate: Tales of the Sword Coast Review;8.1;Great; Even though Tales of the Sword Coast doesn't extend the storyline of the original game, the new areas added by the expansion pack are varied and well designed.;
Baseball Edition 2000 Review;5.5;Mediocre;" Baseball Edition 2000 is more of a ""my favorite team just got whipped in real life so I think I'll take out my aggressions on the computer's weak AI"" sort ...";
Bust A Groove 2 Review;7.3;Good;" The key word to defining Bust A Groove 2 is ""more.""";
Superman Review;1.3;Abysmal; It serves no purpose other than to firmly establish the bottom of the barrel.;
Shanghai: True Valor Review;5.7;Mediocre; Fun in a low-key way.;
MechWarrior 3 Review;8.3;Great; It might seem rough around the edges once in a while, but nevertheless, MechWarrior 3 is a worthy successor to one of the best games of the decade.;
Alexi Lalas International Soccer Review;3.3;Bad; Even the die-hard soccer fan will want to skip this one.;
Railroad Tycoon II - The Second Century Review;8.4;Great; For fans of Railroad Tycoon II who may have exhausted the original scenarios and campaigns, The Second Century adds some hefty new challenges.;
Midtown Madness Review;7.7;Good; Although its driving mechanics aren't terribly sophisticated, it can be a lot of fun because it affords you that very freedom that all driving games should but rarely deliver.;
A Bug's Life Review;6.1;Fair; Children looking to relive the fun of the movie should be pleased with the simplicity of the game.;
High Heat Baseball 2000 Review;2.9;Terrible; High Heat Baseball 2000 is easily the worst baseball game to come out for the PlayStation this year.;

Fleet Command Review;7.5;Good; Fleet Command takes the Harpoon model of real-time naval combat, strips it tothe bone, and wraps it in a simple and visually dynamic  package.;
Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace Review;4.3;Poor; Being a Jedi, at least in this gameworld, is not all it's cracked up to be.;
Star Wars: Episode I Racer Review;8.2;Great; It has a little Star Wars flair to add to its appeal, but the pure racing action alone is enough to make this game a rewarding experience.;

Grand Theft Auto: London 1969 Review;5.9;Mediocre; The GTA London mission pack really doesn't hold a candle to GTA's original three cities, but it still manages to be reasonably fun.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Centipede Review;5.3;Mediocre; While this new Centipede can stand on its own, it fails to capture the magic of the original.;

Pro 18: World Tour Golf Review;4.6;Poor; Pro 18: World Tour Golf isn't necessarily a bad golf game - it's just that so many other PlayStation golf games make the experience more fun.;
East Front II: The Russian Front Review;8.2;Great; East Front II is everything the original East Front should have been when it was released. It's big, engrossing, enjoyable, and true to its board game roots.;

Reah Review;4.9;Poor; If you manage to make it to the end of this tedious affair, you'll know just how awful it really is.;

Star Wars: Episode I Racer Review;8.4;Great; It's even better than the scene that inspired it.;
Omega Boost Review;6.5;Fair; With more levels and design variety, Omega Boost could've outclassed every other 3D shooter on the market.;
Grand Theft Auto: London 1969 Review;5.9;Mediocre; There isn't much new in Grand Theft Auto: London 1969, an expansion pack for DMA's cartoonish carjacking game.;
Magic & Mayhem Review;6.4;Fair; The game features an excellent and robust spell system, but gameplay itself is chaotic, messy, and simple to a fault.;
Jack Nicklaus 6: Golden Bear Challenge Review;9.1;Superb; If you have to buy only one golf game this year, make it Jack Nicklaus 6.;

3Xtreme Review;2.7;Terrible; After playing the game for 30 minutes you'll be wishing you had rented something else.;
NBA In The Zone '99 Review;4.7;Poor; The well-drawn graphics are perhaps the game's strongest point, especially in the dunks and instant replays.;
Yoot Tower Review;4;Poor; Yoot Tower - billed as the sequel to SimTower - is actually no more than a rehash.;
High Heat Baseball 2000 Review;8.6;Great; High Heat Baseball 2000 has its share of problems, but it's clearly the best action baseball game on the market.;
Apollo 18 Review;5.2;Mediocre; You listen to a command, then click the appropriate button. Repeat this about 200 times, and you've got an idea of how thrilling things can get.;
Dance Dance Revolution (Import) Review;8.4;Great; If you liked Parappa, Bust A Groove, Beat Mania, or any of the other music-based games out there, and you don't mind working up a sweat while playing a game, ...;

Sports Car GT Review;3.8;Bad; Sports Car GT is an unpolished racing game that doesn't have anything new to offer in any department.;
Commandos: Beyond the Call of Duty Review;6.6;Fair; Beyond the Call of Duty ends up feeling like a shadow of its former self, being both shorter and more frustrating than the original.;
Rampage 2: Universal Tour Review;4.2;Poor; Rampage World Tour didn't exactly set the world on fire, and Rampage 2: Universal Tour doesn't bring along enough lighter fluid to warrant picking it up.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Jade Cocoon: Story of Tamamayu Review;7.9;Good; Jade Cocoon is easily one of the best-looking games of the year.;
Battle of Britain Review;7.7;Good; Like all Grigsby games, Battle of Britain doles out plenty of detail but leaves much room for improvement.;
Lands of Lore III Review;4.3;Poor; Simplistic gameplay, barren environments, a dated graphics engine, and horrible artificial intelligence collectively make Lands of Lore III an unsatisfying experience.;
CART Flag to Flag Review;6.1;Fair; Aimed mainly at the C.A.R.T. fan, other Dreamcast owners waiting for a great racer would be better advised to look into Sega Rally 2.;
Rampage 2: Universal Tour Review;4;Poor; This game truly makes me wonder if the original was really that much fun or if I was just too young to care.;
Sega Bass Fishing Review;7.3;Good; More of a fishing game than a fishing simulator, Get Bass is a cool, if temporary, way to spend your time. No messy worms either.;
NBA In The Zone '99 Review;5.5;Mediocre; In the Zone '99 can deliver fun gameplay, especially with multiplayer games and three-point shooting contests, if gamers accept its defensive AI and speed flaws.;
Requiem: Avenging Angel Review;7.3;Good; The pacing and story aren't as good as Half-Life's, but the character interaction and angelic powers elevate the game beyond many other shooters.;
Redline Review;7.6;Good; Though it is a better game from behind the wheel than on foot, individual scenarios often require switching modes at critical junctures.;
Fighting Force 64 Review;4;Poor; If you haven't played the PlayStation version, and you are only interested in the game because of your fond memories of playing Final Fight or Streets of Rage, you'd better ...;
Triple Play 2000 Review;7.6;Good; Triple Play 2000 is markedly improved over previous incarnations, but it suffers from a number of annoying glitches, oversights, and bugs.;
Chocobo Racing Review;4.4;Poor; Apparently, there is no stone that Square is willing to leave unturned, because this game is nothing more than a tired rehash of almost everything that's come before it.;
SaGa Frontier II Review;6.6;Fair; SaGa Frontier 2 will likely please RPG fans who are able to overlook the first title's looming shadow.;
Warzone 2100 Review;7.6;Good; Warzone 2100's highly navigable 3D engine, unique campaign structure, and multiplayer gameplay should please most real-time strategy fans.;
Bomberman Fantasy Race Review;5.7;Mediocre; Since Bomberman has long been known to play with fire and explosives, it was really just a matter of time before he added the track to his long list of ...;
California Speed Review;4.6;Poor; If you worship the looks and gameplay style of Midway's Rush series, this game just makes the grade.;
Rollcage Review;7.9;Good; Rollcage is an extremely cool arcade racer that does just about everything right.;
Machines Review;6.5;Fair; This 3D real-time strategy game features enough dazzling visuals for several games of its type, but it's hampered by its been-there-done-that gameplay and poor unit intelligence.;
Civilization: Call to Power Review;6.7;Fair; Whatever else you may think about Call to Power, you have to admire the ambition behind the effort.;
Blast Radius Review;7.2;Good; It just seems more like an expansion pack than anything else.;
Monaco Grand Prix Review;7.3;Good; Why does the world need another F-1 simulation?;

Blue Stinger Review;6.3;Fair; While it may disappoint dyed-in-the-wool Resident Evil fans, Dreamcast newcomers looking for an adventure fix on their new machine should be pleased.;
Micro Machines 64 Turbo Review;6.2;Fair; Any of you seriously craving Micro Machines action on your Nintendo probably won't be too disappointed.;
Pokemon Snap Review;8;Great; Pokemon Snap is a must-buy for fans of the license and probably warrants interest from those who aren't.;
T'ai Fu: Wrath of the Tiger Review;6;Fair; It's a good rental for die-hard players and a decent purchase for newbies and young players.;
Recoil Review;6.4;Fair; Recoil doesn't do anything particularly new. Yet it does a number of things particularly well. But not for particularly long.;
Kita He: White Illumination (Import) Review;5.8;Mediocre;" Kita He (""to the north"") is the first game in the uniquely Japanese genre of dating simulations to hit the Dreamcast.";
Motorhead Review;7.9;Good; If you like pure speed seasoned with good graphics, this is one you definitely don't want to miss.;
Sin Mission Pack: Wages of Sin Review;7.7;Good; With the Wages of Sin mission pack, fans (and detractors) of the original game can see a bit more of Sin at its best.;
Bust-A-Move '99 Review;6.9;Fair; Overall, Bust-A-Move 99 for the N64, like the PlayStation version, is neither a revolutionary take on puzzle games nor a unique take on its own series. Yet it's a good ...;
RollerCoaster Tycoon Review;8.6;Great; RollerCoaster Tycoon has the potential to capture a pretty good niche market - and for the most part, it succeeds.;
Big Air Review;5.6;Mediocre; Certainly this is not an offensive game by any means, but it's remarkably average.;
Populous: The Beginning Review;4.1;Poor; It's not that Populous: The Beginning is a bad game, it's just a bad PlayStation game.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
MLB 2000 Review;8;Great; Other than a few minor modes and some touched-up graphics, MLB 2K is the same game as MLB 99.;
Imperialism II: Age of Exploration Review;8;Great; Imperialism II is a more refined and interesting use of the Imperialism system, with an excellent interplay of elements.;
Superbike World Championship Review;8.2;Great; It may not be the most realistic racing game ever created, but it certainly raises the bar for PC motorcycle racers.;
Rollcage Review;6.2;Fair; The main differences from the Wipeout series are that you're now piloting a four-wheeled vehicle that can drive on walls and ceilings, and the game isn't nearly as good.;
Baseball 2000 Review;4.9;Poor; Baseball 2000 feels, plays, and looks just the way its name sounds: generic.;
X-Wing Alliance Review;8.4;Great; With X-Wing Alliance, Totally Games and LucasArts have at last delivered the game that many players had hoped X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter would be.;
Marvel vs. Capcom Review;9;Superb; While I wouldn't call Marvel vs. Capcom the most balanced fighting game in the world, it makes up for its shortcomings by simply being a whole lot of fun.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Need For Speed: High Stakes Review;8.7;Great; It doesn't really mess with the formula of the last game, but adds enough new features and options to keep its fans excited.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Gex 3: Deep Cover Gecko Review;6.7;Fair; Like Gary Coleman in Diff'rent Strokes, Gex is having a tough time showing off his range.;

R-Types Review;6.1;Fair; Aside from R-Type fans, the casual gamer might find this game too hard and with not enough reward.;
EverQuest Review;8.4;Great; EverQuest is the best game in its class. At the same time, it is loaded with problems.;
Bust-A-Move '99 Review;6.1;Fair; If you already own Bust-A-Move 2, 3, or 4, you probably don't need the PlayStation version of this game.;
Snowboard Kids 2 Review;7;Good; SK2 might be the best party-racing alternative to Mario Kart 64.;
Lode Runner 3-D Review;6.2;Fair; Lode Runner 3-D is a major departure from the gameplay that has served the Lode Runner series so well for more than a decade.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
North vs. South Review;5.9;Mediocre; The engine simulates Civil War warfare about as well as a round peg fits into a square hole.;

Guardian's Crusade Review;7.1;Good; Guardian's Crusade never pretends to be anything besides an enjoyable RPG.;
Um Jammer Lammy Review;8.4;Great; If you didn't play Parappa to death and love every minute of it, you might as well skip out on Um Jammer Lammy.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Resident Evil 2 Review;7;Good; If you can brave its shortcomings, Resident Evil 2 is good, scary fun.;
House of the Dead 2 Review;6.7;Fair; Just a gun that lines up with the sights doesn't seem too much to ask for.;
Monkey Hero Review;3.6;Bad; However it happened, Blam!'s pure intentions went chaotically awry, resulting in one of the worst PlayStation games in recent memory.;
Beetle Adventure Racing Review;8.5;Great; Beetle Adventure Racing is a great deal of fun. It's an excellent game, whatever genre or sub-genre you try to classify it in.;
Aero Wings Review;6.6;Fair; Like Pilotwings 64, Aero Wings has realistic physics, and offers an authentic flying experience.;
Rushdown Review;2;Terrible; Rushdown seems as though it could have been a passable game - three years ago.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Starsiege Review;7.3;Good; Starsiege brings new life to a genre otherwise devoid of it, even if it doesn't really succeed in elevating robot sims out of their long-term rut.;

Dungeons & Dragons Collection (Import) Review;5.6;Mediocre; The bottom line is that, as a very basic scrolling hacker, this game is simply OK.;
Army Men 3D Review;4.6;Poor; With some major spit and polish, plus several more months of development time, Army Men 3D could've turned out a lot better.;
NASCAR Revolution Review;4.1;Poor; NASCAR Revolution isperfect - perfectly wretched, that is.;
Army Men II Review;6.9;Fair; Overall, Army Men II is fun, but it's just not all that it could be.;
Psychic Force 2012 Review;7.1;Good; What will make or break this game for you is really the original and unintuitive gameplay.;

Dead in the Water Review;6.9;Fair; Fans of vehicular combat games should definitely give Dead in the Water a try.;
Beavis and Butt-head Do U. Review;5.4;Mediocre; Illusions has left this fertile comedic ground largely unplowed, thanks to a severe shortage of characters for the boys to interact with and a paucity of places for them to ...;
South Park Review;4.1;Poor; South Park the game comes across as boring and ill conceived and reminiscent of Acclaim's historical track record of botching good licenses.;
Power Stone Review;7.6;Good; Expect to enjoy it immensely for the first week or two, but don't expect to find very much long-term fun.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Turok 2: Seeds of Evil Review;6.7;Fair; Turok 2 starts out poorly, but it does have some redeeming qualities.;

Triple Play 2000 Review;4.8;Poor; Triple Play 2000 for the N64 is a watered-down version of last year's Triple Play for the PlayStation.;
Last Blade The (Import) Review;8.1;Great; For casual players, it may seem like just another disc on the pile, but for enthusiasts it's an extremely deep and enjoyable game that really shouldn't be missed.;
Street Sk8er Review;4;Poor; It's in the gameplay that Street Sk8er really falls flat.;
Final Fantasy VIII Review;9.5;Superb; Cast all fears aside: the latest Final Fantasy is the greatest game ever to bear the name.;

Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri Review;9.1;Superb; Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri is another one of those games that can make hours pass like minutes.;
Pro Pinball: Big Race USA Review;8.7;Great; If you are even remotely interested in pinball, you would be wise to add this to your collection.;
Silent Hill Review;8.2;Great; Konami's first entry in the horror genre - while not quite up to the mark of Capcom's Resident Evil 2 - is a great beginning.;
Extreme Tennis Review;4.7;Poor; If you're absolutely dying to play tennis on your PC, Extreme Tennis might satisfy for a while - but your desperation won't change the fact that it's simply not a ...;
NCAA Final Four 99 Review;6.3;Fair; A game that most casual fans would probably be willing to settle for.;
Evolution Review;7.1;Good; There is no real reason why RPG fans shouldn't go for this one;
Wetrix Review;6.8;Fair; The frantic quality of Wetrix has its charm and the game is fun.;
Civilization II Multiplayer Gold Edition Review;7.3;Good; It's stable, and the options are plentiful and helpful. But the question still remains: Should Civilization even be played as a multiplayer game?;
Chocobo's Dungeon 2 Review;6.1;Fair; Gamers looking for a simple, inoffensive, and remarkably replayable RPG may find solace in the dark, dank, and old-fashioned recesses of Square's dungeons.;
Stratego Review;7;Good; Stratego occupies a gray area that's more flavorful than backgammon or checkers, but it doesn't have the lasting appeal of those games.;
SimCity 3000 Review;8.5;Great; SimCity 3000 is a stable, attractive, finely balanced game with just enough new features to satisfy veterans of the series.;
Evil Zone Review;7.6;Good; Evil Zone is a refreshing surprise from a development team not known for fighting games.;
Sega Rally 2 Review;8.8;Great; Sega Rally 2 marries the qualities of super-fun arcade racing, challenging track elements and design, grease-monkey tinkering, and unparalleled replay value.;
Mario Party Review;7.2;Good; Mario Party is intended to be played with a group of friends, and for those people who can really take advantage of that, this game is a must-buy.;
S.C.A.R.S. Review;7.2;Good; Falling somewhere between Super Mario Kart and Wipeout, Ubi Soft's S.C.A.R.S. mixes cute graphics with familiar arcade racing, power-ups and all.;
H.E.D.Z. Review;5.2;Mediocre; H.E.D.Z.'s inspired design doesn't always translate into inspiring gameplay, and while it's frequently funny, it's not very fun once the novelty wears off.;
Moto Racer 2 Review;8.1;Great; Bigger and better than its predecessor, Moto Racer 2 offers more tracks, more bikes, and a custom track-editing feature that seriously enhances the game's replay value.;
Bloody Roar 2 Review;6.1;Fair; Bloody Roar 2 is a marginal improvement that still suffers from second-best status due to the exclusion of integral gameplay elements that should never have been messed with.;
Sengoku Turb Review;5.1;Mediocre; It'll definitely be in importers' bargain bins before too long.;
Virtual Pool 64 Review;5.8;Mediocre; It's the video game equivalent of a college textbook: great to learn from but not really exciting to read.;
Invasion From Beyond Review;7.6;Good; What King of the Jungle has achieved here is impressive and bodes well for future efforts from this fledgling collection of industry veterans.;
GUNNM Martian Memory (Import) Review;8;Great; For fans of the original manga, this is a must-buy.;
Uprising 2: Lead and Destroy Review;7.7;Good; While the changes to Uprising 2 are notable and (for the most part) positive, the game still manages to underwhelm because of some seemingly minor flaws.;
FireTeam Review;8.5;Great; An excellent brand of online-only team combat, complete with one of the bestall-around player communities on the Net.;
Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus Review;8;Great; Abe's Exoddus is a worthy follow-up to the original and looks beautiful, controls nicely, is plenty difficult, and equally rewarding.;
TNN Outdoors Pro Hunter Review;7.2;Good; With the addition of just a few more fundamentals of hunting, this could have been an exceptionally good game.;
Carnivores Review;7.1;Good; Not only is it a solid hunting simulation, but it features first-rate graphics and sound.;
Wargasm Review;7.3;Good; A promising game bedeviled by several control problems and nagging design issues.;
Castlevania Review;8.2;Great; Let's just hope this doesn't mark the end of the 2D era of Castlevania games.;
Lords of Magic: Special Edition Review;7;Good; The Special Edition corrects a number of flaws and adds several new features but somehow ends up being only a tiny bit more appealing than its predecessor.;
CyberStrike 2 Review;7.5;Good; Combat is where CyberStrike 2 really shines: There are plenty of fancy explosions, a great variety of weapons and components, and numerous opportunities for heavy firefights;
Pool Hustler Review;6.4;Fair; While it's a good game, Pool Hustler is a few steps short of what Backstreet Billiards has to offer.;
Suikoden II Review;7.6;Good; Suikoden II brings nothing new to the genre, but it executes well enough that no one will really care.;
Akuji the Heartless Review;6.2;Fair; It's over a little too quickly to recommend Akuji for purchase, but it's well worth the money and time it'd take to rent it.;
Global Domination Review;3.9;Bad; All 20 missions are pretty much the same: Missile Command with a spinning globe and a few more toys.;
Baldur's Gate Review;9.2;Superb; Baldur's Gate largely manages to meet, and even surpass, gamers' high expectations for this ambitious game.;
Backstreet Billiards Review;7.2;Good; It's the most complete pool-simulation game around for the PlayStation.;
Tom Clancy's ruthless.com Review;6.3;Fair; With such limited gameplay, it's good for little more than a weekend's worth of entertainment.;
Contender Review;6.6;Fair; It may not have real fighters or venues, but it plays well and looks decent.;
Legend of Legaia Review;7.3;Good; Despite the little flaws that keep Legaia from being the world beater that it could have been, it still remains an engaging RPG for anyone who likes to play RPGs.;
Close Combat III: The Russian Front Review;9.2;Superb; Close Combat III: The Russian Front is the best Close Combat game of the bunch.;
BattleTanx Review;5.5;Mediocre; If you've been looking for a good multiplayer game that you and a couple friends can play over and over again, BattleTanx is right up your alley.;
Incoming Review;6.7;Fair; Consider it short-lived fun, at best.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Starsiege: Tribes Review;8.6;Great; Starsiege: Tribes is an ambitious game that successfully delivers a rich and addictive multiplayer gaming experience.;
Bust-A-Move 4 Review;7.9;Good; Fans of the Bust-A-Move puzzle series can look forward to more sleepless months with Natsume's release of Bust-A-Move 4.;
HardBall 99 Review;5.4;Mediocre; For gamers who really get into statistical tracking or team management, HardBall 99's stat-o-rama-based gameplay makes this title a great first choice.;
Dark Vengeance Review;7;Good; Dark Vengeance isn't a bad game, but it doesn't do anything new and doesn't really provide any compelling reason for playing it.;
West Front Review;8;Great; It's obvious that TalonSoft learned from its mistakes following the release of the disappointing East Front.;
NCAA March Madness 99 Review;6;Fair; March Madness 99 is the most complete college hoops sim available, but the game's slow-paced gameplay is a black mark on its record.;
Penny Racers Review;4.6;Poor; Mario Kart 64 or Diddy Kong Racing are still better bets, since the Choro-Q 64 engine is showing its age and showing it badly.;
Powerslide Review;7.5;Good; The tracks are inventive, with jumps, steep hills, and a variety of surfaces that affect traction.;
Test Drive: Off-Road 2 Review;4.8;Poor;" It's an empty feeling no matter how much air you catch or how many times the rad commentator says ""Awesome!"" or ""Sweeeet!""";
Seventh Cross (Import) Review;6;Fair; While it's all in import-friendly English, the game's evolution concept is extremely abstract and all too central to the game to make it truly enjoyable, regardless of the language.;
Ehrgeiz Review;5.8;Mediocre; If you're looking for eye candy, Ehrgeiz will give you plenty of cavities.;
Street Fighter Alpha 3 Review;8;Great; The game's graphical prowess and arcade-perfect gameplay combined with its cache of bonus modes makes Street Fighter Alpha 3 the latest standard for 2D excellence on the PlayStation.;
Tomb Raider III Review;6.9;Fair; The latest Tomb Raider game shows that the series is falling a bit behind the times.;
Milo's Astro Lanes Review;5.5;Mediocre; While Milo's Astro Lanes gets a resounding nod of approval for its daring immersion into subculture (albeit, three years too late), there's very little here to recommend a purchase.;
Dark Side of the Moon Review;6.7;Fair; Nearly all Dark Side of the Moon's puzzles are integrated solidly into the plot and gameplay.;
Fatal Abyss Review;5.6;Mediocre; This is either the most challenging game of the decade or one of the mostflawed games of the year.;
Magic Knight Rayearth Review;5.1;Mediocre; This is the way the Saturn ends, not with a bang but a whimper.;
Dethkarz Review;5.7;Mediocre; Dethkarz follows the futuristic racing formula exactly, without bringing any real personality of its own.;
Kensei: Sacred Fist Review;4.7;Poor; Kensei: Sacred Fist is little more than a bland footnote in fighting game history.;
Falcon 4.0 Review;7.9;Good; So is Falcon 4.0 the second coming of flight simulation or a buggy mess? Alas,it's a bit of both.;
Uprising X Review;6.3;Fair; Overall, Uprising X is a game that may not look visually exciting but is extremely challenging and fun.;
Rugrats: Search for Reptar Review;6.5;Fair; If you've got young kids in your family, they'll likely enjoy it a lot.;
Gangsters Review;5.5;Mediocre; Gangsters has many interesting features, but they don't come together in the big picture.;
Carmageddon II: Carpocalypse Now Review;7.8;Good; If you're not adverse to a little lowbrow humor and a lot of violence and mayhem, you'll find plenty of action and still more fun in Carmageddon II.;
Spec Ops: Ranger Team Bravo Review;6.4;Fair; It's hard to justify buying Ranger Team Bravo, even as an add-on, unless you'rereally hooked - and I mean hooked - on SpecOps.;
Top Gear OverDrive Review;7.3;Good; The multiplayer aspect alone raises the score, but Top Gear Overdrive's rough edges really keep this game from maximizing on all Snowblind's hard work.;
Asteroids Review;7.6;Good; Rather than alter the Space Colonel's original recipe, Activision has opted to simply outfit Asteroids with gobs of bells and whistles.;
Tetris 4D (Import) Review;5.8;Mediocre; The Tetris 4D experience is not worth rushing out to buy a Dreamcast for.;
Smash Court 2 (Import) Review;8;Great; Smash Court 2 is the sequel to Namco's little known tennis game, Smash Court, which was originally released in Japan back in 1996.;
Knife Edge Review;4.9;Poor; If you can remember Pyramid Patrol or Sewer Shark, you know exactly what kind of game it is: a 3D railed shooter.;
Test Drive 5 Review;6.2;Fair; Test Drive 5 looks pretty good in a vacuum, but it simply does not compare well with Need for Speed III.;
Sonic Adventure Review;9.2;Superb; With the Chao-breeding simulation and the minigames, Sonic offers much more beyond the completion of its story.;
Rollaway Review;7.6;Good; Rollaway is a great game that offers just about all the addiction, frustration, and satisfaction a puzzle fan could ask for;
Libero Grande (Import) Review;8.1;Great; Libero Grande is, without a doubt, an unapologetic arcade soccer experience, making no pretenses to heavy stat-tracking or any of that kind of tomfoolery.;
After Dark Games Review;5.5;Mediocre; Unless you have an enormous crush on Hula Girl, you can do better elsewhere.;
King's Quest: The Mask of Eternity Review;7.6;Good; A vast, sprawling experiment that, while falling short of its goal, is enjoyable and noteworthy nonetheless.;
South Park Review;5.8;Mediocre; The license goes a long way to keep the game and story interesting, but it's frustrating that the game itself wasn't better.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
NBA Jam 99 Review;7.1;Good; Those looking for a well-rounded hoops sim won't go wrong with the solidly built NBA Jam 99.;
Wheel of Fortune Review;5.5;Mediocre; This is a game where the only reward is winning money and prizes. Imagining money and prizes is just not the same.;
Myth II: Soulblighter Review;9.3;Superb; Myth II is about as good as a computer game can possibly be.;
Speed Busters: American Highways Review;7.5;Good; The track design is inventive, the illusion of speed is great, and overall the control is good.;
Quest for Glory V: Dragon Fire Review;7.4;Good; Quest for Glory V has a few quirks and problems that will try your patience, but series fans will want to play this game to see old friends and follow ...;
WCW/NWO Thunder Review;5.4;Mediocre; While Thunder does a good job of looking like real wrestling, the gameplay just doesn't hold up.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Fox Sports College Hoops '99 Review;4.3;Poor; It has major gameplay and graphics problems to address before it can even consider competing with the big boys in basketball video games.;
WWII Fighters Review;9;Superb; Even with its quirks, this is a standout game - and one that any fan of World War II air combat will want to play.;
NHL Breakaway 99 Review;6.9;Fair; NHL 99 blows it out of the water.;
Microsoft Pinball Arcade Review;6.2;Fair; You might wonder if other tables from the past would have been more worthy of recreation.;
Jeopardy! Review;7.6;Good; All in all, Jeopardy! is a good computer game. Whether you've always dreamed of being on the hit TV show, love trivia, or just love Alex, it's sure to please.;
S.C.A.R.S. Review;5.7;Mediocre; There really isn't much reason to look this title up over the rapidly growing number of futuristic racers on the N64.;
Starcraft Expansion Set: Brood War Review;9.1;Superb; Brood War completely revitalizes Blizzard's everlasting real-time strategy game.;
July (Import) Review;4.8;Poor; July is a disturbingly bland choose-your-own-adventure book that just happened into a Dreamcast port.;
Formula 1 98 Review;7.5;Good; F1 98 is a terrific F1 sim, but time goes on, standards grow higher, and we yearn for something more.;
Grand Prix Legends Review;8.9;Great; Grand Prix Legends will reward you with arguably the most intense racing experience ever seen on a personal computer.;
Return to Krondor Review;7.9;Good; Return to Krondor may not be an epic sequel to Betrayal at Krondor, but its excellent graphics and immersive plot make it an enjoyable story-driven game.;
Godzilla Generations (Import) Review;3.2;Bad; It's not as if the Godzilla license has ever really turned out a good game, but that doesn't excuse Godzilla Generations from being as terrible as it is.;
You Don't Know Jack: The Ride Review;8.6;Great; Arguably the best You Don't Know Jack since the original.;
Dual Heroes Review;3.7;Bad; It's not often a game this bad is released in the industry.;
Ridge Racer Type 4 Review;8.7;Great; If you've ever cared about any of the games in the Ridge Racer series, then R4 is definitely the racing game for you.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
The Elder Scrolls Adventures: Redguard Review;8.1;Great; The excellent story, unique puzzles, and addictive swordplay help make Redguard an immensely rich and enjoyable adventure.;
Johnny Herbert's Grand Prix World Champions Review;7.9;Good; It makes up for its shortcomings by delivering pulse-pounding excitement and top-notch graphics at a price that anyone can appreciate;
NCAA Gamebreaker 99 Review;8.2;Great; Football fans with an open mind or just the thirst for something new should definitely put GameBreaker 99 through its paces.;
Slingo Review;1.5;Abysmal; Unlike chess, checkers, mah-jongg, or any number of two-player classic or board games, there is absolutely no skill involved whatsoever.;
R-Type Delta Review;8.2;Great; If there's one PlayStation shooter to own, R-Type Delta is that shooter.;
O.D.T. Review;4.8;Poor; Combine the awkward controls with the game's marginal location tracking, and you'll be plunging to your death with alarming frequency.;
No One Can Stop Mr. Domino! Review;6.9;Fair; Mr. Domino is a cute and unique little game, great for casual and veteran gamers alike...while it lasts.;
Settlers III Review;6.1;Fair; Settlers III combines city building and combat, focussing primarily on the former.;
Centipede Review;6.9;Fair; Centipede is at times frustrating, but for the most part, it's a welcome update of a classic shooting game.;
Pen Pen TriIcelon Review;6;Fair;" The game, as a whole, is a little too simplistic to hold the interest of most players, eventually relegating Pen Pen TriIcelon to the ""especially good for younger players"" category.";Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Fighter Pilot Review;4.6;Poor; For someone who's never played a computer game, Fighter Pilot might be fun for a little while.;
Populous: The Beginning Review;7.5;Good; This isn't a Populous for the 3D-accelerator age;
FIFA 99 Review;8.2;Great; If your definition of a great soccer game begins and ends with dead-on realism, you can't go wrong with FIFA 99.;
FIFA 99 Review;8.4;Great; While not completely perfect, it's deep on options, packed with real teams and players, and presented with a slick interface.;
Virtua Fighter 3tb Review;8.2;Great; For Joe Blow on the street, Soul Calibur is still the better choice, but Virtua Fighter fans will find all they need neatly wrapped in this package.;
Plane Crazy Review;5.5;Mediocre; If not for the flawed controls, horrific course design, and extremely limited gameplay options, it might just be a good game.;
Star Wars: Rogue Squadron 3D Review;8;Great; If you enjoy a good shooter, you should give Rogue Squadron a try.;
Turok 2: Seeds of Evil Review;9;Superb; It's a landmark shooter and a must-buy.;
Star Wars: Rogue Squadron Review;7.9;Good; Any fan of the first level of Shadows of the Empire really should check out Rogue Squadron.;
Eggs of Steel Review;4.1;Poor; While the synthesis of cinema, computer animation, and console gaming was an inevitability for the games industry, Eggs of Steel clearly stands as a victim of unfulfilled ambition.;
Tiger Woods 99 PGA Tour Golf Review;7.5;Good; Although arriving on the scene later than some other golf games, Tiger Woods 99 is still as good a golf sim as you're likely to find.;
FIFA 99 Review;9.2;Superb; FIFA 99 is a good choice for the neophyte, and an almost-essential upgrade for the die-hard soccer enthusiast.;
101 Airborne: The Airborne Invasion of Normandy Review;8.8;Great; 101 simulates the chaos of an airborne drop very well, and the level of detail is tremendous.;
Enemy Infestation Review;7.1;Good; It has a few shortcomings, but Enemy Infestation is chock-full of challenging and addictive alien butt-kicking goodness.;
NBA Live 99 Review;8.9;Great; When you strip away all the great new graphics and new season play, the core of the game is still great fun.;
Israeli Air Force Review;8.1;Great; As a worthy successor to Navy Fighters and ATF, it provides a sweeping selection of planes and mission types for gamers looking for quick fun instead of painstaking realism.;
Blood II: The Chosen Review;7.4;Good; It's hard to fault Blood II for not doing anything new;
Thief: The Dark Project Review;9.1;Superb; Its emphasis on stealth, strategy, and ingenuity, coupled with its strong narrative structure and excellent mission design, adds up to a game that's stylish, serious, rewarding, and unique.;
Fallout 2 Review;8.8;Great; The core elements of 1997's best role-playing game are intact and, in several ways, have been improved.;
Railroad Tycoon II Review;9.1;Superb; With Railroad Tycoon II, all those dreams of childhood can be realized at last.;
KKND 2: Krossfire Review;5.7;Mediocre; It's not horrible, as in Conquest Earth horrible, but it's not the type of game that causes you to make exclamations of glee while playing.;
Heretic II Review;8.1;Great; You wouldn't want to live there, but the world of Heretic II is a beautiful place to visit.;
Knockout Kings Review;7.7;Good; Overall, Knockout Kings is the best representation of the sport of boxing in a game so far.;
Vigilance Review;5;Mediocre; Vigilance succeeds only in making you wonder how good it could have been if it had been done right.;
Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter (Import) Review;7.3;Good; If you're still interested in the Saturn, then this game is definitely one to import.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
The Blackstone Chronicles Review;5.5;Mediocre; The Blackstone Chronicles isn't a bad game. It's just average to a fault.;
Peter Jacobsen's Golden Tee Golf Review;5.2;Mediocre; A more full-featured, technically competitive version of Golden Tee Golf could earn a place alongside the best of the field.;
European Air War Review;8.7;Great; European Air War doesn't push the state of the art, but it excels at good, old-fashioned gameplay.;
Sanctum Review;7.5;Good; The bottom line is that you won't find anything extremely tantalizing about Sanctum, but it does offer some fun gameplay at a more than reasonable price.;
Red Baron 3D Review;9;Superb; Kudos to Sierra and Dynamix for taking a disappointing disaster and turning it into the best World War I simulation yet.;
Deer Hunter II Review;5.8;Mediocre; You can walk around, the horrible map screen has been replaced by a cool GPS device, and the game looks a lot better, albeit not to the quality of most ...;
Ultima Online - The Second Age Review;6.3;Fair; The Second Age adds some nice new features and fixes a few things, but it introduces a whole slew of its own problems.;
Brigandine Review;6;Fair; Brigandine screams mediocrity.;
Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus Review;9.4;Superb; If you hated the first one, it's likely because of the lack of save points, so you should definitely consider giving this series another try.;
Glover Review;5.1;Mediocre; If you have a lot of patience and like challenge in your games, you may get a lot of gameplay out of this title;
Psybadek Review;5.1;Mediocre; At no point during the game do you feel compelled to play.;
NBA Live 99 Review;8;Great; The NBA season may still be in jeopardy, but Live is open for business and always ready for a game.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Warhammer 40000: Chaos Gate Review;8;Great; Warhammer is a complex, vastly entertaining strategy gaming system, and Chaos Gate does full justice to it.;
Nightmare Creatures Review;6.7;Fair; It's really great to see a port of a game not make all the mistakes the original did, and it makes the title much easier to recommend.;
Tomb Raider III Review;7.5;Good; Those who lost interest in the series with Tomb Raider II may want to give it another look with the third.;
Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time The Review;10;Essential; Ocarina of Time definitely follows in the footsteps of the previous games, and the result is a game that can't be called anything other than flawless.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Trespasser Review;3.9;Bad; Trespasser is a frustrating game, filled with boring gameplay and annoying bugs.;
NFL Quarterback Club 99 Review;7.5;Good; The story of Acclaim's NFL Quarterback Club 99 is a tale of two games.;
Half-Life Review;9.4;Superb; Half-Life is the closest thing to a revolutionary step the genre has ever taken.;
Sin Review;7.7;Good; Sin is for the first-person shooter fan who wants more of the same, done just a little different, but done right.;
Smart Games Challenge 3 Review;7.2;Good; While Smart Games 3 offers a wide assortment of puzzles, many of them are Mensa-only mind benders.;
Twisted Edge Snowboarding Review;6.6;Fair; In the end, Twisted Edge turned out to be too little, too late.;
Asteroids Review;7;Good; While it might make a better rental than a straight-up purchase, either way you won't go wrong.;
Twisted Metal III Review;4.7;Poor; Take a look at Activision's Vigilante 8 or GT Interactive's Rogue Trip instead.;
Montezuma's Return Review;7.3;Good; It features an engine chock-full of bells and whistles and gameplay that would feel right at home on a console.;
Street Fighter Collection 2 Review;7.2;Good; Consider it a history lesson.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Apocalypse Review;7.1;Good; All in all, the developers really wasted Bruce Willis' talents and missed an opportunity to do something extremely cool.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Extreme Paintbrawl Review;1.7;Abysmal; This disappointing first-person combat game pushes the genre one step too far, attempting to wed a tired game engine with the paintball phenomenon.;
Rush 2 Extreme Racing USA Review;5.1;Mediocre; Rush 2 attempts to embody the spirit of San Francisco Rush but fails to deliver as a sequel and a game.;
Total Air War Review;9.1;Superb; This is, quite simply, one of the most addictive, entertaining, and approachable jet combat sims I've ever seen.;
Creatures 2 Review;6.3;Fair; It's quite charming, and the training, raising, and relationships you experience are, well, quite real.;
DarkStalkers 3 Review;7.9;Good; It's easily the best fighter Capcom has put out in years.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Rally Cross 2 Review;7.7;Good; While Rally Cross 2 seems to have all the ingredients needed to be a worthy successor to the original classic, the game on the whole seemed to have lost some ...;
Magical Tetris Challenge Review;5.9;Mediocre; Magical Tetris Challenge does offer a degree of the familiar cataleptic state puzzle game fans are so fond of, but if you already own a Tetris game, you probably don't ...;
Space Bunnies Must Die! Review;5.7;Mediocre; Bad play control, inconsistent hit detection, and plain or frustrating level design, makes for a game that, at least, feels like the sum of its parts.;
Pro Pilot '99 Review;7.5;Good; The good news is that Pro Pilot '99 is a dramatic improvement over that first release, building on the features of that initial release and filling many of the holes.;
Assault: Retribution Review;4.2;Poor; While the basics may sound playable enough, Assault's problems are almost too many to list in this review.;
A Bug's Life Review;2.7;Terrible; It is obvious that Disney was more interested in producing a $40 advertisement for its movie than in developing a playable game.;
Sentinel Returns Review;7.7;Good; From the beginning of the manual, to the design of the Sentinel itself, so much is made of the game's surrealism, it seems like an alibi for the lack of ...;
Rage of Mages Review;7.5;Good; It isn't particularly original in any specific regard, but its solid combination of features collectively form a unique and enjoyable role-playing game.;
VR Baseball 2000 Review;7.5;Good; VR Baseball 2000 is a decent game but one that does not hold a clear edge over any of the others in the genre.;
Test Drive: Off-Road 2 Review;6.1;Fair; Surprisingly enough, Test Drive Off-Road 2 winds up being a better-playing racing game than Test Drive 5.;
Age of Empires: The Rise of Rome Review;7.4;Good; All the additions are nice, but they aren't necessary for your continued enjoyment.;
War Along the Mohawk Review;6.3;Fair; War Along the Mohawk consists of a lot of good and ambitious ideas thrown into a melting pot and mixed haphazardly.;
Delta Force Review;9.1;Superb; If ever there was a game that proved the value of gameplay over graphics, it's Delta Force.;

Axis & Allies Review;8.2;Great; The result of all of Hasbro's diligent faithfulness to the source is a great version of a classic board game.;
Deadly Arts Review;3.4;Bad; Don't waste your time or money on this one.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Space Station Silicon Valley Review;7.1;Good;" Ultimately, SSSV is a simple, moderately short game, with extremely engaging ""personalities"" that hit the game character target right on the mark.";
Crash Bandicoot 3: WARPED Review;8.9;Great; This time the game takes place across a great expanse of time and space, making for greatly diverse level designs, which in turn keep the game fresh.;
Ninja: Shadow  of Darkness Review;5.3;Mediocre; Core gamely attempts to mix things up by throwing in some wicked physical hazards, cool-looking ninja spells, and simple puzzle elements, but it's not enough to make Ninja more than ...;
Streak Review;5.1;Mediocre; Streak is surprisingly rough around the edges for a third-generation racing game.;
Barrage Review;6;Fair; Barrage is heavy on two themes. The first is flying around in a hovercraft. Thesecond is blowing the hell out of anything that even resembles a threat.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
WipeOut 64 Review;6.9;Fair; WipeOut 64 isn't horrible, it just feels like the developer's first effort for the system at times - which it is.;
Links LS 1999 Edition Review;9.1;Superb; Three years of improving this engine has made Links one of the most well-rounded and finely crafted software products on the market.;
Die by the Sword: Limb from Limb Review;5.1;Mediocre; It's just sad that the best part of this campaign is what made the original one disappointing: its brevity.;
Klingon Honor Guard Review;6.4;Fair; Klingon Honor Guard is a decent action game utilizing the Star Trek franchise.;
The Game of Life Review;6.7;Fair; The PC conversion of The Game of Life brings some of the charm of the original and tampers very little with the formula.;
Small Soldiers Review;4.7;Poor; In the world of video games, there are three great truths: Eating food you find on the ground makes you healthier, criminal masterminds leave plenty of loaded weapons lying around, ...;
UltraCorps Review;8;Great; UltraCorps is recommended to anyone interested in a simplistic, slow-paced sci-fi strategy game.;
Test Drive 5 Review;6.3;Fair; When you think of all the other games that Test Drive 5 tries to emulate, you're thinking of at least three other racing games that you should purchase before you ...;

Cool Boarders 3 Review;4.9;Poor; Unfortunately, Cool Boarders 3 isn't the sequel we had all hoped for - changing developers for this third game really hurt the series a lot.;
Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator Review;7.5;Good; The strongest element of Combat Flight Simulator is the flight experience itself.;
Dragonseeds Review;5.6;Mediocre; When compared with a game as deep and personable as Monster Rancher, Dragonseeds pales in comparison.;

Body Harvest Review;7;Good; For gamers looking for something almost completely unique or even just a big, dumb game to fill the void before Zelda comes out, Body Harvest fits the bill nicely.;
Grim Fandango Review;9.3;Superb; In addition to being a very good adventure game, it features great writing and beautiful art direction.;
Gunmetal Review;6.4;Fair; While this game is certainly no Shogo or even Descent II, Gunmetal does have some good points and a boatload of potential.;
Sentinel Returns Review;8.1;Great; Once you get the hang of it, the game reveals itself to be a unique hybrid of styles and moods.;
WCW/NWO Revenge Review;7.2;Good; Remember WCW vs. NWO: World Tour, THQ's last Nintendo 64 wrestling game? Revenge builds on the previous game but makes most of the same mistakes.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.

Lode Runner 2 Review;8.2;Great; Lode Runner 2 is a welcome change from all those card and board game ports - not that I don't love a good board-game port, I just like a little ...;
Activision Classics Review;5.5;Mediocre; Considering you can pick up many playable 2600 cartridges at flea markets for about one dollar or so, if you just want to occasionally play some of your favorite old ...;

Motorhead Review;6.2;Fair; Only the most ardent racing fans need apply.;
Ares Rising Review;5.8;Mediocre; In light of recent space sim successes like Descent: Freespace and Independence War, it's difficult to take Ares Rising too seriously.;
Team Losi RC Racer Review;4.2;Poor; Overall, Team Losi RC Racer is a below-average racing game, regardless of the RC car gimmick and license.;
NHL 99 Review;8.4;Great; The sense of satisfaction I get from victories or even hard-fought losses more than compensates for any frustration I'm experiencing.;
MediEvil Review;8.2;Great; All in all, it's a welcome surprise.;
Fifth Element The Review;2.4;Terrible; No need to waste time clamoring about lousy feature film to video game metamorphoses;
Madden NFL 99 Review;8.5;Great; The game gives you everything you could ever want on the features side, plus the ability to change them.;
Shining Force III Scenario 3 (Import) Review;8.5;Great; By now, if you've resigned yourself to the fact that the likeliness of seeing Scenario 2 or 3 in English is rather slim, the import route might be worth considering.;
NHL FaceOff 99 Review;5.8;Mediocre; NHL 99 is easily the better choice.;
TimeShock! Pro-Pinball Review;6.3;Fair; It responds just as you would expect it to respond and puts on a pretty good act. But it is an act.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Knights and Merchants Review;5.5;Mediocre; It's hard to recall another game in which you have so little direct control over events, and yet are called upon for so very much micromanagement.;
Clue: Murder at Boddy Mansion Review;7.6;Good; Basically, if you love the board game, you're going to want this version. And if you haven't played the board game, buy this instead.;
Need for Speed III Review;8.9;Great; Not only is the latest Need for Speed miles ahead of the last NFS game, but it approaches (and dare I say surpasses?), the best of the consoles in terms ...;
NHL 99 Review;7.9;Good; NHL 99 retains the outstanding gameplay of the original 16-bit games.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
All Japan Woman Pro Wrestling (Import) Review;4.9;Poor; All Japan Woman Pro Wrestling offers a tiny handful of modes compared with current wrestling games.;
Capcom Generation 2 (Import) Review;7.1;Good; A lesson in great game design.;

Madden NFL 99 Review;8.8;Great; This is unquestionably the best edition ever, with significant and welcome improvements in every conceivable category.;
Wild 9 Review;5.1;Mediocre;" Delivered in a nasal surfer tone that makes people think disparaging things about California, the main character's comments sound like a 40-year-old ad exec's idea of what ""the kids"" think ...";
Shogo: Mobile Armor Division Review;8.1;Great; Shogo never feels pointless and, with its careful attention to narrative as well as action, is clearly of the new breed of shooters.;
Unholy War The Review;7.9;Good; It comes from the creator of such classics as Star Control and Archon, and many similarities to these games can be drawn.;
Tales of Destiny Review;4.9;Poor; Namco's Tales of Destiny is one of those RPGs that should've been left abroad.;
X Games Pro Boarder Review;8.7;Great; Overall, X Games Pro Boarder is the best snowboarding game out for the PlayStation.;
Independence War Review;9.1;Superb; Independence War not only provides the most detailed flight and systems modeling yet seen in a space sim, it also provides a complex, rewarding plot and a fully fleshed-out gaming ...;
Destrega Review;7;Good; The biggest problems are its level of challenge and puny replay incentive.;
Cruis'n World Review;5.9;Mediocre; Rent this one, but it really isn't worth purchasing.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Hexplore Review;6.9;Fair; It's a decent game, but it doesn't represent the state of the art in role-playing games.;
NASCAR 99 Review;6.9;Fair; For the casual driving-game fan that almost likes NASCAR racing but never has bothered to watch an entire race, you may want to think about the 50 laps you have ...;
NFL Blitz Review;9;Superb; NFL Blitz offers an intoxicating mix of blazingly fast gameplay, high-octane graphics, and ear-splitting sound.;
Return Fire 2 Review;8.1;Great; A nearly perfect combination of action and strategy topped off with some pretty serious pyrotechnics.;
JetFighter: Full Burn Review;6;Fair; Mission Studios has essentially taken the Jetfighter III engine and wrapped it all in a cinematic narrative that would have shamed Digital Pictures.;
Brunswick Circuit Pro Bowling Review;7.4;Good; Even if you aren't a bowling fan, and couldn't care less about this game, you really should see the video clips at least once.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Juggernaut Corps: First Assault Review;5.5;Mediocre; The best that can be said about it is that it's an adequate 2D shooter with an attractive price tag.;
Quake II Mission Pack: Ground Zero Review;7.9;Good; Quake II is a year old, but the new weapons and power-ups make the game interesting again.;
Duke Nukem: Time to Kill Review;7.5;Good; Duke Nukem: Time to Kill, places our boy in a Tomb Raider-style world, where players control him from a behind-the-back perspective as he runs, jumps, climbs, and flips switches much ...;

Heart of Darkness Review;7.1;Good; Heart of Darkness isn't a bad game. It's a bit short and a bit frustrating, but it's always moderately fun and it's occasionally very fun.;
NHL 99 Review;8.4;Great; It may still be a bit sluggish on the frame rate side, but if you're a fan of previous NHL titles, you won't be disappointed.;
iF/A-18E Carrier Strike Fighter Review;6;Fair; Will Carrier Strike Fighter, like Falcon and Tank Platoon II, rise above its initial shoddy release to become a classic?;

People's General Review;8.8;Great; People's General represents the natural evolution of Panzer General II and the Living Battlefield series.;

NCAA Football 99 Review;6.7;Fair; After a few games, the AI really started to show its problems.;

KO the Live Boxing (Import) Review;2.2;Terrible; KO The Live Boxing is the latest of the Japanese boxing games that combines the simulation aspects of Boxer's Road with the 3D action of Center Ring Boxing, but not ...;

Gex 64: Enter the Gecko Review;4.7;Poor; Do yourself a favor and stay away from this lizard.;

NFL Blitz Review;8.8;Great; Blitz is the most addictive sports game ever created.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Emergency: Fighters for Life Review;4.6;Poor; The truth is that Emergency has so many faults that it could use some major rescue work itself.;

S.C.A.R.S. Review;7.6;Good; Hokey premise or not, the game has a lot going for it.;
Spearhead Review;7.4;Good; The game offers a handful of features and elements that seem ideal forhard-core sim fans, but the mission designs and the general feel of gameplayseem more appropriate for an action ...;
Point Blank 2 Review;8.1;Great; Fans of Point Blank will certainly not be disappointed, and those who thought Point Blank was a bit too remedial will probably be right at home.;
Dune 2000 Review;5.5;Mediocre; While some may take away from Dune 2000 a fleeting sense of nostalgia for the classic, most will invariably leave the game disappointed and wondering how a true sequel might ...;
GT 64 Championship Edition Review;5;Mediocre; GT 64 is by no means a bad racing game.;
C: The Contra Adventure Review;3.6;Bad; It's hard to believe that Konami would release yet another sorry game with the Contra name on it.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Redline Racer Review;6.7;Fair; Good looks and a fast pace don't add up to top-shelf gameplay, and Redline Racer falls a bit flat where it could have easily excelled.;
Radiant Silvergun (Import) Review;9;Superb; Simply put, this is the finest example of the genre you will find on any platform, home or arcade, to date.;
Motocross Madness Review;8.4;Great; With its multitude of modes and good terrain graphics, this is pretty much everything you could hope for in a motocross simulation, and then some.;
Spyro the Dragon Review;8.3;Great; Yes, it's taken some time, but there's finally a proficient, fully 3D platform game for the PlayStation.;
Bottom of the 9th 99 Review;5;Mediocre; Overall, Bottom of the Ninth is a fair baseball title. But when it comes to sports games, fair isn't what you're looking for.;
Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Review;8;Great; While generally better than Spec Ops, Rainbow Six carries its own baggage, especially where the conflict of realism versus gameplay rears its ugly head.;
Mortal Kombat 4 Review;8.3;Great; Fans of the other versions of MK4 won't be disappointed with this excellent translation.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.

Get Medieval Review;7.1;Good; One fact will immediately become apparent when playing Get Medieval: This game is Gauntlet.;
Urban Assault Review;6.5;Fair; There are lots of missions and lots of branches so you can complete several missions in varying order, but all the missions end up playing the same.;
Deathtrap Dungeon Review;6.2;Fair; If you didn't care for Tomb Raider's third-person perspective and camera angles then Deathtrap Dungeon will probably leave you cold.;
NFL GameDay 99 Review;8.6;Great; In the end GameDay 99 is the total package.;
Redjack: Revenge of the Brethren Review;6;Fair; It's a shame that someone decided to go and spoil a decent adventure game by including action elements.;
Madden NFL 99 Review;8.3;Great; New animations, like receivers tracking the ball with their head, really give the players a life of their own.;
Spice World Review;2.3;Terrible; Wait for the next album, the next movie, the next TV special, or whatever. But don't bother buying this game.;
Rival Schools: United By Fate Review;7.8;Good; If you're looking for an easy-to-pick-up fighting game that puts a slightly new spin on the old fighting genre, Rival Schools fits the bill pretty well.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Heart of Darkness Review;7.8;Good; Heart of Darkness is the latest platform/puzzle game from the creators of Out of this World and Flashback.;
Revenge of Arcade Review;5;Mediocre; Revenge of Arcade's big problem is, surprisingly, the selection of games.;
Command & Conquer Red Alert: Retaliation Review;5.9;Mediocre; The game could have been better adapted for the console set, perhaps even by adding in a few basic search-and-destroy missions in the start.;
Jazz Jackrabbit 2 Review;8.5;Great; Fans of the traditional side-scrolling platform game will not be disappointed.;
Fox Sports Soccer 99 Review;7.3;Good; Though not without a handful of control issues and flaws in commentary, the freshness of Fox's approach makes for a great game.;
Deep Fear (Import) Review;7.8;Good; If you really want to play this game you should definitely pick up the import.;
Granstream Saga The Review;6.7;Fair; This hack-and-slash action/role-playing game is pleasant, but it just doesn't live up to its ambition and ends up feeling small and empty.;
Kartia Review;7.7;Good; Kartia's a game with substance and style, one that wins you over without resorting to flashy pyrotechnics or cheap gimmicks.;
M.A.X. 2 Review;5.3;Mediocre; There's no denying that M.A.X.2 has all the ingredients of a great game, but strange quirks in the game engine and some downright bugs prevent it from reaching its full ...;
Dracula X (Import) Review;8.3;Great; Highly recommended no matter what system you own, Dracula X will always be a classic.;
Virtual Chess 64 Review;6.1;Fair; The 3D view's lack of visual clarity makes for a frustrating game.;
NCAA Football 99 Review;7.8;Good; It's a pretty complete game and one that should satisfy just about any college football fan.;
Icarus: Sanctuary of the Gods Review;6;Fair; A game that's as stupefyingly average as this one wouldn't be worth a second glance if it had any competition.;
Leisure Suit Larry's Casino Review;6.1;Fair; The combination of the Leisure Suit Larry franchise and a casino game sounds like a match made in sleaze heaven.;
Adidas Power Soccer 98 Review;5.8;Mediocre; Adidas Power Soccer 98 does a number of things well, but its shortcomings are frustrating enough to turn most players off before the whistle blows.;
F-1 World Grand Prix Review;7.9;Good; The frame rate problem and lackluster sounds are not enough to mar what is otherwise an excellent racing sim.;

F-Zero X Review;7.5;Good; Practically flawless from a technical standpoint, the biggest thing missing from F-Zero X is that it lacks a soul.;

TOCA Touring Car Championship Review;7.8;Good; TOCA Touring Car Championship is basically a mix of Gran Turismo and Destruction Derby.;
Iggy's Reckin' Balls Review;6.7;Fair; For all Iggy's trademark puzzle-game annoyances, it also has the perks.;
Jeremy McGrath Supercross '98 Review;5.4;Mediocre; Jeremy McGrath Supercross '98 is another in a long string of marginal PlayStation racing games.;
Fox Sports Golf '99 Review;1.4;Abysmal; It's more often than not that a sports game fails to live up to gamers' expectations, and with just cause.;
WarBirds Review;8.9;Great; In exchange for your money, you're getting a quality flight simulation with continued support and some of the most experienced opponents to ever play online.;
Batman & Robin Review;5.7;Mediocre; Batman & Robin is the best Batman game in years and far better than the '97 Joel Schumacher film it was based on, but neither of those things really amounts ...;
Vangers: One for the Road Review;4.8;Poor; Confusing. Off-putting. Indecipherable. Mystifying. These are just a few of the words that crept into my mind as I wrestled with what should have been a fairly straightforward game of ...;
Tomba! Review;8;Great; Tomba is like a blast from the past, with a twist.;
Waialae Country Club: True Golf Classics Review;6.6;Fair; Golf fans waiting to get a taste on the N64 can start with the clapping and cheering, because Nintendo has finally brought home a golf game to its flagship system.;

Turbo Prop Racing Review;4.5;Poor; Compared with VR Sports' Power Boat Racing, Turbo Prop Racing is better in every possible way.;
Sol Divide (Import) Review;7.5;Good; Despite the interesting premise and the thoughtful execution, Sol Divide does have its drawbacks.;
Guilty Gear Review;7.9;Good; These fighters are a mix of the usual Ken/Ryu/Zangief ilk, with a little Samurai Shodown thrown in for good measure.;
Total Annihilation: Battle Tactics Review;6.9;Fair; Anyone who's still playing Total Annihilation presumably knows the ropes by now. While Battle Tactics is certainly a strong product by typical standards, it is disappointing in light of Total ...;
WarGames Review;7.1;Good; WarGames is a decent real-time strategy game in the Command & Conquer vein.;
Flesh Feast Review;4.9;Poor; The game is about as lifeless as the zombies it hurls into your path.;
Master of Monsters Review;4.9;Poor; You'd be better off saving your money for stronger strategy RPGs.;
Off Road Challenge Review;4.5;Poor; Anyone who is interested in this game shouldn't be.;
NAM Review;4;Poor; NAM strives to deliver the fun and intensity of a first-person action game and the realism of a simulation - and because of that indecision it ultimately fails on both ...;
WWF War Zone Review;8.6;Great; While WWF War Zone plays similarly to its predecessors, it presents a package that is completely unmatched in both gameplay and in atmosphere.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Brave Fencer Musashi Review;7.7;Good; A Zelda killer it's not, but considering what's being offered here, it should more than make up for any unfortunate comparisons.;

Phantasy Star Collection (Import) Review;7;Good; For the completist, Phantasy Star Collection provides considerable value.;
Fox Sports Soccer '99 Review;4.2;Poor; Even with its numerous problems, Soccer '99 has one flaw that stands above therest: gameplay.;
Descent: Freespace - The Great War Review;8.9;Great; It's a noble effort to both cannibalize the best elements of classics of the genre and also provide a number of refreshing innovations.;
Devil Dice Review;6.9;Fair; Unlike the legions of Tetris clones that populate the puzzle-game market, Devil Dice is as unique a game as its predecessor was and about ten times as hard.;
Team Apache Review;7.9;Good; It falls into a nether region between Comanche and Longbow for realism and playability, but offers some unique elements that have not been seen before in a sim.;
NFL Xtreme Review;3.5;Bad; NFL Xtreme is no NFL Blitz.;
Shining Force III Scenario 2 (Import) Review;8.5;Great; If you like strategy RPGs, do yourself a favor and pick up Shining Force III Part 2.;
X-Wing Collector Series Review;8.2;Great; These are classic games that belong on every computer gamer's shelf, no doubt about it.;

Dragoon: The Battles of Frederick the Great Review;7.8;Good; Dragoon may be a bit rough along the edges, but it's a gem nonetheless.;

Beast Wars: Transformers Review;4.7;Poor; Beast Wars is an imperfect but fun 3D over-the-shoulder shooter.;
Front Mission Alternative (Import) Review;6.8;Fair; Were it not for the game's outstanding graphics and sound, Front Mission Alternative would invariably be a total dud.;
Mission: Impossible Review;6.6;Fair; Mission: Impossible's main problems stem from its inconsistency from level to level.;
Pocket Fighter Review;3.5;Bad; Are those two fighters really smoking opium in that igloo?;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.

Cardinal Syn Review;4.8;Poor; Visually, Cardinal Syn is quite appealing.;
MechCommander Review;7.3;Good; A beautiful-looking strategy game whose design flaws, few as they are, prevent it from achieving its rightful greatness even in spite of its many strengths.;
Quest 64 Review;5.4;Mediocre; Its primary flaw is oversimplicity on all fronts.;
Banjo-Kazooie Review;9.5;Superb; It doesn't stray too far from the formula, but it makes the logical progressions you would expect Nintendo to make.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.

Risk Review;7.7;Good;" Hasbro Interactive has successfully ""ported"" one of the oldest and most popular turn-based strategy games to the PlayStation.";
Extreme Tactics Review;5.8;Mediocre; In spite of the myriad possibilities the unit-design feature brings to gameplay and its wonderfully simple interface, Extreme Tactics is likely to disappoint many real-time strategy fans.;
Jersey Devil Review;5.2;Mediocre; Every so often a title comes along that, for whatever reason, you really want to like.;
Redneck Rampage Rides Again Review;7.9;Good; This isn't a cookie-cutter sequel at all. It's half shoot-em-up, half laugh riot - and that adds up to a damn good deal to me.;

Flying Dragon Review;5.8;Mediocre; Flying Dragon isn't a bad fighting game, but it does little to differentiate itself from the pack.;

VR Baseball 99 Review;5.3;Mediocre; The game just doesn't have the polished look of Triple Play or MLB.;
Mortal Kombat 4 Review;8.6;Great; This is a good translation of a good arcade title, and fans of the arcade version won't be disappointed.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
The Operational Art of War Vol. 1 Review;9;Superb; The Operational Art of War is a class act all the way, offering almost every feature a wargamer could want.;
Bomberman Wars (Import) Review;5.8;Mediocre; It's all becoming clear now - Hudson is determined to kill its highly recognizable Bomberman license.;

Circuit Breakers Review;3.7;Bad; Circuit Breakers is a rip-off of the Micro Machines series of games.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Dominion: Storm Over Gift 3 Review;5.9;Mediocre; Its lack of distinguishing features renders it entirely tedious for real-time veterans, while its difficulty and bland presentation make it the wrong choice for newcomers to the genre.;
Quake II Mission Pack: The Reckoning Review;7.4;Good; The question you need to ask yourself is whether you enjoy Quake II enough to merit playing it again, because The Reckoning is a supplement rather than an improvement.;
Soukaigi (Import) Review;5.6;Mediocre; While certainly a commendable effort, games like Soukaigi really don't stand a chance of reaching their full potential in the 32-bit era.;
Aero Gauge Review;4.5;Poor; Ascii's AeroGauge runs basically along the same conceptual lines of play as Psygnosis' Wipeout XL or Acclaim's Extreme G.;
Tennis Arena Review;5.6;Mediocre; With no stat tweaking and no licenses, Tennis Arena is arcade-style tennis at its most fundamental.;

Nagano Winter Olympics '98 Review;3.3;Bad; Nagano '98 should be avoided at all costs.;
Addiction Pinball Review;8;Great; While it doesn't have the ultrarealism of a game such as Pro Pinball: Timeshock, Addiction Pinball offers more sensory gratification.;

Road Rash 3D Review;7.6;Good; Road Rash 3D's a great single-player racing game;
Nagano Winter Olympics '98 Review;3.5;Bad; Nagano '98 isn't entirely bleak.;
Wetrix Review;8.8;Great; Those who loved Tetrisphere will probably like Wetrix, and that those who hated Tetrisphere will probably like Wetrix as well.;
Microsoft Baseball 3D Review;7.4;Good; If Microsoft comes through on its promise to fix the game's flaws, this could easily be the best arcade baseball game out there.;
Incubation: The Wilderness Missions Review;8;Great; This add-on pack pushes Incubation closer to the excellent, long-lasting strategy game it should have been in the first place.;
iF-22 Persian Gulf v5.0 Review;6.9;Fair; Those who were wary of the initial, flawed release may want to try iF-22 this time around.;
Bomberman Hero Review;6.7;Fair; Bomberman Hero once again places our bombastic buddy in the role of platform protagonist.;
Soldiers at War Review;8;Great; If you're not looking for a time-intensive, stat-heavy WWII experience, then Soldiers at War is definitely worth a spin.;
Unreal Review;8.4;Great; What gives Unreal an edge is how these differences, while not always positive, distinguish it from the legions of other 3D shooters.;
Mega Man Legends Review;7.2;Good; It's deftly avoided the pitfalls that await most platformers making the jump from 2D to 3D by creating an action-RPG instead.;
Microsoft Golf 1998 Edition Review;8.4;Great; It's so much better than any of the previous Microsoft Golf games that the only way you'd know it had anything to do with the previous versions is from the ...;
World Cup 98 Review;8.8;Great; Ultimately, World Cup 98 is soccer at its best.;
World Cup 98 Review;8.6;Great; Die-hard soccer fanatics will find that the added tactical possibilities of World Cup 98 are worth the ticket price.;
Sanitarium Review;8.2;Great; Broken into eight chapters, the entire game is a journey through your own madness to potential salvation.;
Hot Shots Golf Review;8.3;Great; In a move bound to please golf enthusiasts and curious onlookers alike, Sony has brought its flagship golf game to our shores under the moniker of Hot Shots Golf.;
Spec Ops: Rangers Lead the Way Review;6.8;Fair; Spec Ops has nearly all the ingredients of a really good game, but bugs andother gameplay problems hamper it, and the end result is something less thanspectacular.;
Gungriffon II (Import) Review;7;Good; It's a solid enough game, better than Armored Core or Mechwarrior, but it does little to distance itself from its older brother.;
Bio F.R.E.A.K.S. Review;6;Fair; While I'm sure it will strike a chord with some, most will probably tire of Bio F.R.E.A.K.S. fairly quickly.;
Speed Power Gunbike (Import) Review;6.6;Fair; Speed Power Gunbike is one of the most challenging games to come around in a long time. OK, forget about it, the thing is impossible.;
Forsaken Review;6.4;Fair; If you're without a PC or N64, pick up the PlayStation version without fear.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Chopper Attack Review;6.4;Fair; It's fast, fun, and pretty exciting.;

All Star Baseball '99 Review;8.3;Great; ASB '99 is easily one of the best baseball games to come around in quite some time.;
Total Annihilation: The Core Contingency Review;8.1;Great; What we have here is an avalanche of new material, which, depending on how you view it, may or may not be a good thing.;
Mortal Kombat 4 Review;8.9;Great; Fans of the arcade version won't be disappointed at all.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
iPanzer '44 Review;3.3;Bad; Interactive Magic had the opportunity to exploit the wide-open market for a serious World War II tank simulation. Unfortunately, those who pinned their hopes on this game are in for ...;
Forsaken 64 Review;8.5;Great; Between the various multiplayer options and the great single-player mode, Forsaken 64 comes out a real winner.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Theme Hospital Review;7.3;Good; Following in the footsteps of Diablo, Theme Hospital has arrived almost completely intact on the PlayStation.;
Panzer Commander Review;6.9;Fair; Someday, there will be a World War II armored warfare simulation with the essential features that fans of this genre want. Until then, we'll have to settle for Panzer Commander.;
Armor Command Review;7;Good; Because of the game's, um, different interface, the two 3D views are interesting in application but almost useless in practice.;
Soukyugurentai (Import) Review;8.2;Great; Soukyugurentai is an old-school 2D shooting masterpiece that fans of the genre really shouldn't miss.;
Panzer Dragoon Saga Review;9.2;Superb; It's almost fitting, in the twilight of the Saturn's years, that it should end as it began.;
Bio F.R.E.A.K.S. Review;5.7;Mediocre; Bio F.R.E.A.K.S. is a bloody 3D fighter that features jetpacks, shields, and other crazy stuff.;
Monster Truck Madness 2 Review;7.4;Good; The designers wisely recognized that the subtlety of monster truck racing cried out for the added nuance that only a professional wrestling tie-in could bestow.;
Riven: The Sequel to Myst Review;5.5;Mediocre; I believe the developers of Riven did the best job they could porting this game over to the PlayStation;
The Golf Pro Review;7.2;Good; If you don't like the concept of the mouse swing, chances are The Golf Pro won't change your opinion.;
Breath of Fire III Review;6.9;Fair; Even with its handful of new features, Breath of Fire III breaks little new ground.;
Tactics Ogre Review;7.9;Good; While the game is new to US gamers, Tactics Ogre will be a blast from the past for just about everyone.;
Reel Fishing Review;1.4;Abysmal; Whether you love real fishing or not, you'll probably hate Reel Fishing.;
Hardball 6 Review;7.1;Good; There's no doubt it's got some good things to offer - just not as many as you might expect for a sequel that spent this long in development.;
Toukon Retsuden 3 (Import) Review;6.6;Fair; Definitely one to check out, though with its entirely Japanese menu screens and booklet, American players may want to wait and cross their fingers for a domestic release.;
Forsaken Review;8.9;Great; Forsaken is, at its core, a Descent clone. But stunning graphics, a dazzling array of weapons, and above-average level design make the whole thing seem fresh.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Broken Sword: Shadow of the Templar Review;5.8;Mediocre; Weaving a tale of murder, mystery, mayhem, and medieval history, Revolution Software has ported its popular PC title Circle of Blood to the PlayStation.;
F1 Racing Simulation Review;9;Superb; F1 Racing Simulation is an extremely well-thought-out simulation with driversof all abilities in mind.;
Grand Theft Auto Review;8;Great; If you're armed with weapons and a strong disrespect for authority, you might just want to take that Body Count song to heart and become a cop killer.;
World Cup 98 Review;8.6;Great; On the basis of AI improvements alone, World Cup 98 is highly recommended.;
Army Men Review;7;Good; While the plastic soldier theme might have been better served if it had played up the Toy Story angle a bit more, the end result is fun nonetheless.;
Newman/Haas Racing Review;7.3;Good; True to its real-world inspiration, Newman/Haas Racing provides brilliant moments of racing euphoria separated by vast stretches of relative monotony.;
VR Sports Powerboat Racing Review;4.4;Poor; Arcade racing fans looking for a change of pace may very well be intrigued by VR Sports' new Powerboat Racing. Unfortunately, the game suffers from so many flaws that it ...;
WarBreeds Review;6.6;Fair; WarBreeds harbors many great ideas and features. Unfortunately, these are hampered by a lackluster manual and gameplay glitches.;
Outwars Review;7.8;Good; The very things that make it unique and interesting are also the source of some of its most frustrating aspects.;
Tail Concerto Review;6.9;Fair; Experienced players will breeze through the game in less than five hours, almost never having to push the limits of their gaming prowess.;
Rampage World Tour Review;5;Mediocre; Unless you were a freak for the original game, you'll tire of RWT very quickly.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
F-15 Review;9.2;Superb; Following hot on the heels of Longbow 2, F-15 is, if possible, an even more impressive piece of work.;
Rascal Review;4;Poor; Rascal is a visually confusing 3D adventure that is as entertaining as shopping in a crowded grocery store.;
Kobe Bryant in NBA Courtside Review;5.9;Mediocre; Courtside easily adds up to the best basketball game on the N64, which, unfortunately, isn't much of a feat.;
Parasite Eve Review;7.2;Good; Expect to finish the game all the way through in no more than 15 hours.;
Dragon Force 2 (Import) Review;7.9;Good; Dragon Force 2 is almost a complete rehash of the first title, only now with a new story and a handful of new features.;
G Darius Review;8.3;Great; G Darius does have a few flaws, but most are overshadowed by the rest of the game.;
Burnout: Championship Drag Racing Review;7.3;Good; Sure, the races in Burnout might only last seven or eight seconds - but those are some pretty intense seconds indeed.;
High Heat Baseball 1999 Review;7.8;Good; Underneath High Heat's less-than-spectacular graphics engine lies a very impressive baseball game.;
Great Battles of Caesar Review;7.3;Good; Great Battles of Caesar for the most part has stuck to its guns, both good and bad, with basically the same engine that began the series.;
San Francisco Rush Review;3.1;Bad; Folks, this game is about as bad as games get.;
Warhammer: Dark Omen Review;8.3;Great; Dark Omen is exciting, visually superb, and features an elegant interface.;
Olympic Hockey 98 Review;5;Mediocre; The only possible way I could recommend this game is if you're an avid Olympic hockey fan.;
SaGa Frontier Review;6.9;Fair; SaGa Frontier is a solid, if not exactly stellar, RPG.;
MLB 99 Review;6.2;Fair; MLB 99 is a sound baseball game, and fans of last year's MLB 98 will surely enjoy it.;
House of the Dead Review;7.3;Good; Basically, a marriage of Capcom's zombie thriller Resident Evil to the popular Virtua Cop gun game series.;
Hexen II Mission Pack: Portal of Praevus Review;8.6;Great; This is clearly a must-have for Hexen II fans, and even critics of the original game should find the new features, creatures, levels, and weapons suitably impressive.;
Mystical Ninja starring Goemon Review;6.7;Fair; Mystical Ninja is a solid, quirky, and entirely rehashed title that holds its own well against the horde of painful Mario clones.;
Ultim@te Race Pro Review;7.8;Good; A top-tier racing game with spectacular visuals, solid gameplay, and a surprisingly good multiplayer mode. It's not perfect by any stretch, but it is a lot of fun.;
Dark Reign Expansion: Rise of the Shadowhand Review;8.7;Great; Rise of the Shadowhand accomplishes the challenging feat of significantly improving one of last year's best and most complex real-time strategy games.;
Midway Presents Arcade's Greatest Hits: The Atari Collection 2 Review;4.3;Poor; You're still better off tracking down the arcade versions of these games.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Deathtrap Dungeon Review;3.7;Bad; Deathtrap Dungeon turns out to be at the low end of games for the Sony PlayStation.;
Starship Titanic Review;7.1;Good; All in all, Starship Titanic is an enjoyable tribute to an older era of adventure gaming.;
Of Light and Darkness Review;6.9;Fair; At its worst, it seems more like the second season of Twin Peaks, when the obscurity gets self-serving, and the payoff is meager compared with its initial pretensions.;
Mastermind CD-ROM Review;4.1;Poor; In the case of Mastermind, Hasbro Interactive may have been better off leaving well enough alone.;
Sega Touring Car Championship Review;4.2;Poor; Sega's renowned for creating great-looking arcade racing games, so it's a little surprising it would shove this ugly little game out onto store shelves.;
VR Sports Powerboat Racing Review;2.7;Terrible; If you're a fan of powerboat racing and think it's neat that it has been turned into a video game, don't get your hopes up.;
Aliens Online Review;7.2;Good; With so much to gain and absolutely nothing to lose, any self-respecting Aliens fan should give Aliens Online a try.;
Die by the Sword Review;7;Good; Die by the Sword goes well beyond its almost admirably typical premise to deliver a visually stunning, terribly challenging, and often awe-inspiring dungeon hack.;
Bust-A-Move 3 Review;6.2;Fair; Whereas developer Taito's Bust-a-Move 2 was a lotta puzzle, Bust-a-Move 3 is a whole lotta puzzle.;
Mischief Makers Review;6.7;Fair; Mischief Makers is a good game that will leave players wanting more.;
Vampire Savior (Import) Review;8;Great; An arcade-perfect translation with very little load time.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Mobile Suit Z-Gundam (Import) Review;4.4;Poor; The Gundam series has spawned yet another game. This time around it's a third-person robot shooter that takes a few pages from Sega's Virtual On.;
Ultraman Fighting Evolution (Import) Review;5.7;Mediocre; The last reason you want to get your hands on this one is for its gameplay.;
Starcraft Review;9.1;Superb; It doesn't stray far from the blueprint created by its predecessors, but it is, without a doubt, the best game to ever adhere to that formula.;
M1 Tank Platoon II Review;8.2;Great; M1 Tank Platoon II is still an extremely well-done and researched simulation, and is almost worthy of the name.;
Ray Tracers Review;5.4;Mediocre; While Ray Tracers is a pretty neat game, it's way too easy and far too short to purchase.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Blasto Review;4.2;Poor; There's a good game here - it's simply hidden under many layers of frustration.;
Judge Dredd Review;2.5;Terrible; It's pretty hard to believe that someone at Activision saw this game and felt that it was worth bringing out in the States.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Black Dahlia Review;5.9;Mediocre; What begins as an interesting tale of conspiracy and murder ends up a confused and confusing gore fest of the not-so-supernatural.;
ReBoot Review;4.1;Poor; As is no surprise to anyone following the history of video game licenses, the game offers mediocre gameplay whose few innovations are overshadowed by the half-baked quality of the game's ...;
Star Wars Rebellion Review;4.5;Poor; Buried somewhere inside Rebellion is an interesting, albeit familiar, game. But along the way, things break down, and conquering the galaxy becomes an exercise in tedium.;
Need for Speed III: Hot Pursuit Review;8.3;Great; Need for Speed III is one of the best times I have had playing a racing game.;
Sorry! CD-ROM Review;7.4;Good; Hasbro Interactive has not only crafted a faithful representation of this ageless board game, but in so doing has included an array of extraordinary features that breathe new life into ...;
Critical Blow (Import) Review;6.9;Fair; Critical Blow is a game that is worthy of a US release, but will probably never see the light of day over here.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Bushido Blade 2 Review;7.9;Good; This year's model comes equipped with sharper character graphics, a simplified, yet more complete fighting system, and best of all, many more characters to select from.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Auto Destruct Review;4.4;Poor; Auto Destruct could've been a modernized city-based version of Midway's Spy Hunter, but it ended up as a G Police that got grounded.;
Triple Play 99 Review;8.3;Great; The good news is that Triple Play 99 does deliver many notable improvements. The bad news is that this year's version comes complete with its own set of annoying bugs.;
Dead or Alive Review;7.3;Good; Combining fantastic graphics and above-average gameplay, Dead or Alive is a fun and challenging fighting game well worth picking up.;
Croc: Legend of the Gobbos Review;4.2;Poor; The operative word here is cute, on the order of Fraggles, M&M spokescandies, and the language of R2D2.;
Xenogears Review;9;Superb; Xenogears' reliance on story, subtlety, and mood make it Square's most anime-like RPG thus far, in many ways making the game one of its best.;
Tex Murphy: Overseer Review;6.3;Fair; The big disappointment in Overseer is its puzzles - a real shame, given the fine plot and good acting.;
Chron X Review;8;Great; Along with the obvious comparisons to Magic: The Gathering, Chron X also combines elements of Risk, Shadowrun, and Chaos Overlords.;
Ultima Collection Review;7.9;Good; The Ultima Collection is a praiseworthy historical document, an excellent value, and paradoxically, an unfortunate disappointment.;
The Journeyman Project 3: Legacy of Time Review;5.8;Mediocre;" While it looks nice, sounds nice, and plays nice, JP3 is a game hampered by its noticeable lack of story, sloppy writing, and one really annoying ""feature.""";
Deadlock II: Shrine Wars Review;7.2;Good; Deadlock II is a perfect game for people who like galactic empire building but don't enjoy managing dozens of planets and star fleets.;
Pitfall 3D: Beyond the Jungle Review;7.1;Good; While not perfect, Pitfall 3D is a very fresh and original platform game in many ways.;
Tekken 3 Review;9.9;Superb; Tekken 3 is the best PlayStation game to come along in a long time.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
NBA ShootOut 98 Review;4.7;Poor; Compared with other basketball titles out this year, ShootOut 98 is at the bottom of the pile.;
Semper Fi Review;6.8;Fair; Semper Fi is basically a platoon-level, turn-based, hex-based wargame depicting modern land warfare.;
NHL Breakaway 98 Review;7.8;Good; Breakaway 98 can easily be called the best hockey game on the N64.;
Robotron 64 Review;5.9;Mediocre; Maybe Midway knew what it was doing when it dropped this project.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Tenchu: Stealth Assassins Review;8.3;Great; Tenchu excels in every way that counts.;
1080 Snowboarding Review;8.6;Great; 1080 Snowboarding is the best snowboarding game around.;
Burning Rangers Review;6.2;Fair; Probably the last really good Saturn game.;
Shadow Master Review;4.7;Poor; There's no question that Shadow Master uses a breathtaking graphics engine. Gameplay, on the other hand, is neither new nor extraordinary - far from it, in fact.;
Interstate '76 Arsenal Review;7.2;Good; While some of the new missions are creative, you can't help but wish there weresome overarching story to tie them all together.;
Grand Theft Auto Review;6.4;Fair; Small details - like the beeping sound a truck makes when it backs up, the various engine sounds, or the way pedestrians scream and run if you drive on the ...;
Enemy Zero Review;5.3;Mediocre; While the game does put an interesting spin on the first-person shooter, the ridiculous oversights and design flaws of the adventure component stifle what fun there is to be had.;
X-Men vs. Street Fighter Review;3.6;Bad; I like the Street Fighter series as much as the next guy, but this is taking it way too far.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Triple Play 99 Review;7.2;Good; Triple Play 99 is the way to go if you want a realistic baseball sim to play.;
Star Trek Pinball Review;5.2;Mediocre; Aesthetically, Star Trek Pinball contains a rather uninspired suite of flashing lights, shooting cues, and sound effects.;
Battlezone Review;9.4;Superb; What really makes Battlezone so special is the way it blends the adrenaline rush of first-person action games with the strategy and resource management of Red Alert.;
Spawn the Eternal Review;1.8;Abysmal; Spawn the Eternal is one of the worst games ever to shame the PlayStation with its presence.;
Speed Racer Review;4.2;Poor; You could pick just about any other racer off the shelf and have more fun.;
Magic: The Gathering - Duels of the Planeswalkers Review;6.1;Fair; Duels is definitely aimed at newbies to Magic and, as a stand-alone product, it's a damn fine translation of the card game.;
Bomberman World Review;5.2;Mediocre; While Bomberman World isn't a particularly bad game per se, it's clearly not the best representative of what the series has to offer.;
NBA Fastbreak '98 Review;7.1;Good; NBA Fastbreak '98 packs most of the play options from other games into one, and the result is a pretty good first attempt.;
Diablo Review;8.3;Great; Blizzard's Diablo, winner of GameSpot's PC Game of the Year for 1996, has finally made it onto the PlayStation.;
Grandia (Import) Review;9.3;Superb; Grandia beats out FF7 in all of the ways that matter.;
Gex: Enter the Gecko Review;6;Fair; While the game is technically proficient, the unbelievably lame speech and camera problems make Gex: Enter the Gecko a frustrating title at best.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Klonoa Review;9.2;Superb; It may be a bit too cute for its own good.;
Armored Moon: The Next Eden Review;2.2;Terrible; It's obvious then that the folks at Microforum who decided to release Armored Moon, its entry into the over-saturated real-time strategy market, had a marked lack of common sense.;
East Front Review;6.7;Fair; East Front remains a paradox. Parts of it are exceptionally well done whileother parts tend to cancel out its positive aspects.;
Bridge Deluxe II with Omar Sharif Review;5.6;Mediocre; I thought Bridge Deluxe II would be a great way to start learning bridge. It's not.;
Duke Nukem: Total Meltdown Review;4.8;Poor; Running on a PlayStation, the game suffers from sketchy graphics and limited control.;
Combat Chess Review;6.2;Fair; If you're a casual player who wants the option to see some action with your chess game, then it's not a bad purchase.;
NCAA March Madness '98 Review;6.9;Fair; It's obvious that the March Madness development team did its homework.;
USCF Chess Review;5.7;Mediocre; If you don't already know the dos and don'ts of castling etiquette, don't expect to win many games here.;
Yoshi's Story Review;5.3;Mediocre; Yoshi's Story is good for a rental at best.;
Power Chess 98 Review;7.6;Good; If Sierra can up the ante in terms of tutorials, game analysis, and openings, the next Power Chess will have the stuff to challenge Chessmaster 5500 for chess supremacy.;
Midnight Run (Import) Review;2.7;Terrible; Don't look for this hunk of junk to come out here - ever.;
Deer Hunter Review;5.5;Mediocre; While Deer Hunter may be fun and charming the first few times you play the game, it doesn't go much beyond that.;
Midway Presents Arcade's Greatest Hits - The Midway Collection 2 Review;6.6;Fair; This collection of arcade emulations will provide solid retro fun.;
Famista 64 Review;4;Poor; Famista 64 isn't worth the extra expense that imports warrant.;
Tom Clancy's Politika Review;4.5;Poor; Politika's low production values, simplistic gameplay, and lack of opponents render it as obsolete as the Iron Curtain.;
Dead or Alive (Import) Review;6.8;Fair; In the end, Dead or Alive is an above-average fighting game.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Einhander Review;7.9;Good; If you like shooters, you'll love Einhander.;
Chameleon Twist Review;5.1;Mediocre; Chameleon Twist isn't worth ragging on too badly because it's not outwardly offensive in any way.;
Mass Destruction Review;7.9;Good; Above all, Mass Destruction is good, clean fun.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Quake Review;6.4;Fair; Are you very, very good with a Saturn controller?;
Battlespire Review;6.7;Fair; Battlespire's less expansive scope, hack-and-slash gameplay, and technical problems ultimately provide a role-playing experience that is only occasionally satisfying.;
Games People Play: Hearts Spades Euchre Review;7.9;Good; Card games lend themselves well to Internet play, and this one is no exception. Just stay away from the solo play, and you should be entertained.;
Joint Strike Fighter Review;7;Good; JSF is mighty fun and points toward a promising future for Innerloop.;
Command & Conquer: Red Alert Review;7.6;Good; There are new weapons, enemies, and levels, but the game engine and basic play are essentially the same.;
NBA In The Zone '98 Review;3.6;Bad; NBA In The Zone isn't much of a basketball game by any standards.;
NBA In The Zone '98 Review;5.6;Mediocre; When playing against other people, NBA In The Zone '98 is pretty fun.;
The Ultimate RPG Archives Review;7.3;Good; All 12 games in the package remain enjoyable to this day, each in turn a testament to the timelessness of the genre.;
Final Fantasy Tactics Review;8.9;Great; Role-playing games don't get a whole lot better than Final Fantasy Tactics.;
SkullMonkeys Review;5;Mediocre; What is most frustrating about SkullMonkeys is that it just wears you down after a while.;
Fighter Ace Review;6.6;Fair; Those looking for some action and who don't give much thought to realism shouldgive it a try;
Fighters Destiny Review;7.8;Good; It isn't perfect, but it still blows away the competition by a long shot.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Balls of Steel Review;7.5;Good; The best pinball games have hidden levels, animated beasties, and plenty of surprises. Balls of Steel has all the above.;
Frogger Review;5;Mediocre; It's a far cry from the simple chore of helping a frog cross a busythoroughfare, but is it really more satisfying?;
Beast Wars Review;5;Mediocre; Beast Wars is an imperfect but fun over-the-shoulder shooter.;
Demonstar Review;4.7;Poor; A bit of advice: Save your cash and just download the shareware version of Raptor - you'll have a lot more fun.;
Bust A Groove Review;7.6;Good; If PaRappa left you wanting more games in that vein, Bust A Groove makes for a good follow-up.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
Guntu Western Front June 1944 (Import) Review;1.7;Abysmal;" In the words of the immortal Luke Skywalker, ""What a piece of junk.""";

Quake Review;6.9;Fair; Quake's masonry environments and gangly monsters seem right at home in N64 territory.;

Caesars Palace Review;4.2;Poor; Caesars Palace is an adequate adaptation of casino gambling.;
Sumo Battle (Import) Review;3.9;Bad; Sumo Battle is an action/sports simulation that tries to depict every aspect of what a sumo wrestler must go through.;
Evolution Review;6;Fair; While there is a great deal of information and a brilliant concept at play here, the actual experience of Evolution drains your enthusiasm rather quickly.;
Red Baron II Review;7.1;Good; Red Baron II has a lot to offer, but its rushed shipment makes for a game that's appealing only to those sim fans willing to deal with quirks and inconsistencies ...;
PaRappa The Rapper Review;8.5;Great; The rapping is surprisingly credible - there isn't a wack MC in the bunch.;
Jedi Knight: Mysteries of the Sith Review;7.8;Good; As an expansion pack for a now-classic first-person action game, Sith is very good - but it isn't great.;
Pro Pilot Review;6.1;Fair; With the glaring omissions fixed and a graphics overhaul, Pro Pilot could be contender.;
Descent to Undermountain Review;3.7;Bad; How could the company that produced Fallout also be responsible for one of the lousiest games to come down the pike in quite a while?;
Shadow Master Review;7.2;Good; Shadow Master is more than a Doom-clone art show;
Hoyle Classic Card Games Review;7;Good; Sierra does a nice job of bringing classic card games to the PC.;
FIFA Road to World Cup 98 Review;8.5;Great; This year's FIFA will keep soccer fans returning to their N64s, season after season.;

Red Asphalt Review;6.9;Fair;" Red Asphalt is a solid contribution to the ""drive 'n' kill"" genre.";
FIFA Road to World Cup 98 Review;7.8;Good; Soccer has never played better on the Sega Saturn than with FIFA 98.;
Front Page Sports: Ski Racing Review;8;Great; Though the graphics are impressive and the sound effects are inspiring, FrontPage Sports: Ski Racing falls a split-second short of a gold medal run.;
Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero Review;4.9;Poor; This one is only for the hard-core MK fans who don't already own PlayStations.;Jeff Gerstmann has been professionally covering the video game industry since 1994.
X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter: Balance of Power Review;8.3;Great; Balance of Power does an admirable job of addressing almost all the complaints gamers had with the original game.;
NHL All-Star Hockey 98 Review;6.8;Fair; NHL All-Star Hockey 98 is a pretty good hockey game.;
Armed & Delirious Review;6;Fair; Armed & Delirious is blander than it thinks it is and certainly less clever and entertaining than it should have been.;
Moto Racer Review;7.2;Good; A racing title worth checking out.;
Syn-Factor Review;4.7;Poor; The payoff is never as heavy as the suspense and definitely not worth the amount of time spent figuring out the solutions.;

Resident Evil 2 Review;8.9;Great; Resident Evil 2 is one of the most entertaining games I've ever played.;
Scud: Industrial Evolution Review;4.9;Poor; The end result is a generic shooter, thinly veiled by its use of an inventive comic series.;

NBA Live 98 Review;7.9;Good; NBA Live 98 is an improvement over Live 97 in almost every category.;
NBA Live 98 Review;4.4;Poor; With graphics that simply look confusing and sound that is nearly non-existent, Live 98 is just a dull basketball game.;

Front Page Sports: Trophy Rivers Review;6.7;Fair; Occasionally boring, at times just plain annoying, but generally realistic andcomprehensive, Trophy Rivers is surely a game that only a fisherman could love.;
Courier Crisis Review;2.3;Terrible; Even the most radical bunny-hop couldn't save the resultant product.;
Elemental Gearbolt Review;7.5;Good; Working Designs' revisions have made it a much more challenging gun game - one that's now much easier to recommend.;
Rampage World Tour Review;3;Bad; Rampage World Tour is a colossal waste of time.;

Sega Touring Car Championship Review;5;Mediocre; Sega Touring Car Championship is a mixed bag.;
Mass Destruction Review;7.3;Good; The game, while earth-shatteringly simple, does require more than a little strategy and ends up offering quite a challenge.;

Shipwreckers! Review;6.4;Fair; This is one of the more child-safe games to come along in a while.;
Turok: Dinosaur Hunter Review;7;Good; Playing this violent masterpiece - with its flashy arsenal of weapons and lifelike cretins - is a technically arresting adventure.;
War Wind II: Human Onslaught Review;8;Great; It may not be the most highly talked-about game ever to crash the real-time party, but it is certainly one of the most entertaining.;

Steep Slope Sliders Review;7;Good; I prefer Sega's Steep Slope Sliders over its current competition, Sony's Cool Boarders 2;
iF-16 Review;7.1;Good; If Digital Integration's iF-16 feels about a year old, there's a good reason: Essentially, it is.;
Chessmaster 5500 Review;9.4;Superb; The worst thing you can say about Chessmaster 5500 is that you might not want to spend the bucks on it if you already own Chessmaster 5000.;
Automobili Lamborghini Review;7.7;Good; Automobili Lamborghini strips racing down to its most essential element: speed.;

NetStorm: Islands at War Review;7.1;Good; Despite its numerous strengths, the game just doesn't have much longevity.;

Monopoly Star Wars Review;6.1;Fair; Though not an entirely bad idea, the actual combination of the two proves to be somewhat pointless.;

Quake II Review;9;Superb; Whatever else may be said about Quake II, one thing is certain: It is the only first-person shooter to render the original Quake entirely obsolete.;
Galapagos: Mendel's Escape Review;6;Fair; Galapagos can be pretty much summed up in four words: great idea, questionable implementation.;
Streets of SimCity Review;4.4;Poor; If you've ever played Activision's Interstate '76, you'll no doubt notice its influence in Streets of SimCity.;

Crush! Deluxe Review;6;Fair; This turn-based future sport product is not a great game, but it does have unique charms.;

ABC Monday Night Football '98 Review;5.9;Mediocre; MNF '98 is definitely an improvement over its predecessor, but it still has aways to go before it can be considered a true champion.;
Zork Grand Inquisitor Review;8;Great; Grand Inquisitor is the best graphical Zork yet, and one of the most consistently entertaining adventures of the year.;
The Curse of Monkey Island Review;9;Superb; Like its predecessors, The Curse of Monkey Island has all the makings of a classic.;
